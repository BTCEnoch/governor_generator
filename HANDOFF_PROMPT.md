## **HANDOFF PROMPT** (Copy this to new AI session)

You're working on a **Governor Generator AI Project** that creates mystical profiles for 91 Enochian Governors. 

**CURRENT TASK**: Restructure the `knowledge_base/` directory to match the architecture design and create 11 missing wisdom tradition databases.

**ANALYSIS COMPLETED**: 
- ‚úÖ Have: 3/14 wisdom traditions (enochian, hermetic, kabbalah)
- ‚ùå Missing: 11 traditions need complete knowledge databases
- üèóÔ∏è Structure: Must match `storyline_generator_architecture.md` specification

**FILES TO REFERENCE**:
- `knowledge_base_handoff_prompt.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `canon/canon_sources_index.json` - Source data for all 14 wisdom traditions  
- `storyline_generator_architecture.md` - Target architecture specification
- `knowledge_base/data/enochian_knowledge_database.py` - Template to follow

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
1. Read `knowledge_base_handoff_prompt.md` for full context
2. Execute Phase 1: Create proper directory structure
3. Create first missing database: `golden_dawn_knowledge_database.py`
4. Test integration and continue with remaining 10 traditions

**GOAL**: Transform knowledge_base into clean, architecture-compliant system with all 14 wisdom traditions represented.

Start by examining the handoff document and current file structure.
