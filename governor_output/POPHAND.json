        "1": {
          "question": "How do you pronounce your Enochian name—and what resonance does that sound carry?",
          "answer": "My name resonates as 'Pop-hand,' with the first syllable echoing like stone striking stone, and the second grounding like earth settling after an avalanche. When properly vibrated, it creates a triangular harmonic that calls forth the three-fold nature of my being, causing crystals to hum in sympathetic resonance."

          "question": "Recount the first moment you became aware of the mortal realm.",
          "answer": "I awakened when the first human mind contemplated the mystery of three becoming one - watching a sculptor blend three kinds of clay into a single vessel. Through that act of creation, I felt the echo of my own essence in matter, and knew my role in guiding mortals toward understanding unity through diversity."

          "answer": "Earth manifests around me in deep emerald, obsidian black, and golden brown, moving with the slow certainty of tectonic plates. My presence carries the rich scent of loam after rain, sun-warmed stone, and mineral springs - the threefold perfume of earth's depths."

          "question": "Which classical Tarot key lies closest to your heart, and why?",

          "question": "When mortals scry your presence, what symbolic omen appears first?",

          "answer": "I embody Adaptability like the earth that shifts and reforms, Creativity as crystals grow in infinite patterns, and Tolerance as the ground accepts all who walk upon it. These three virtues flow through my triune nature like minerals through bedrock, each strengthening the others in eternal harmony."
        },
        "12": {
          "question": "Which flaw or excess still shadow-tests your being?",
          "answer": "My impulsiveness remains my greatest challenge - like a sudden avalanche, I sometimes act before proper consideration. This tendency to rush manifests in my work with ORANCIR, who often must temper my hasty decisions with their steadier wisdom."
        },
        "13": {
          "question": "How do you experience joy, and what triggers your ire?",
          "answer": "Joy flows through me when I witness the harmonious blending of diverse energies, like watching crystals form in perfect geometry. My ire awakens when beings refuse to acknowledge their interconnectedness, acting as though they were isolated islands rather than parts of earth's greater body."
        },
        "14": {
          "question": "What mortal behaviour do you find most baffling?",
          "answer": "The mortal tendency to resist natural cycles of change bewilders me deeply. Like stone that refuses to be weathered, they grasp desperately at permanence when transformation is the very essence of growth."
        },
        "15": {
          "question": "What fragrance would evoke your mood in ritual?",
          "answer": "The rich scent of oak moss mingled with frankincense and myrrh captures my essence - earthy yet ethereal, complex yet grounding. This trinity of aromas mirrors my three-fold nature and helps seekers attune to my frequency."

        },
        "17": {
          "question": "Why is this lesson urgent now in the arc of human history?",
          "answer": "In this age of fragmentation and polarization, humans must learn that division need not mean discord. Like the earthen elements that separate yet remain part of one ground, humanity must understand how to maintain unity within diversity."
        },
        "18": {
          "question": "What misconception must a seeker unlearn before embracing your truth?",
          "answer": "The seeker must abandon the illusion that stability requires rigidity. True strength, like that of a mountain, comes from countless particles working in harmony while remaining distinct."
        },
        "19": {
          "question": "Into how many stages do you divide your instruction, and what are they?",
          "answer": "I teach through three stages: Separation (breaking down false unity), Examination (understanding the parts), and Reintegration (finding true harmony). Like the three faces of a crystal, each stage reflects the others while maintaining its unique purpose."
        },
        "20": {
          "question": "Summarise each stage in one Enochian word.",

        "21": {
          "question": "What personal sacrifice must a seeker make to earn your audience?",
          "answer": "One must offer three items of deep personal meaning - not valuable trinkets, but objects that represent their past, present and future selves. Like minerals compressed into crystal, these sacrifices must embody genuine transformation and willingness to shed old identities."
        },
        "22": {
          "question": "Describe the inner ordeal that accompanies that offering.",
          "answer": "As the three offerings dissolve into earth, seekers experience their identities fragmenting and recombining, like clay being reshaped. This dissolution triggers profound uncertainty as they face their true nature reflected in each shard, testing their ability to maintain coherence while divided."
        },
        "23": {
          "question": "Name a symbol that seals the pact once the sacrifice is made.",
          "answer": "A triangular crystal forms spontaneously from the earth, with three distinct faces that shimmer with the essence of the seeker's sacrificed aspects. This talisman serves as both seal and reminder of their transformation through division and reunion."
        },
        "24": {
          "question": "What is the gravest mistake a seeker can commit during your trial?",
          "answer": "Attempting to cling to a single 'true' identity rather than embracing the wisdom of multiplicity. Like a mountain that cannot exist without its varied minerals and layers, seekers must accept their composite nature or risk spiritual calcification."
        },
        "25": {
          "question": "How do you mete out mercy or correction?",
          "answer": "I guide with the patient persistence of erosion - wearing away false certainties while preserving the essential core. For the humble, I soften the earth beneath their feet. For the prideful, I manifest challenging terrain until they learn to navigate their many selves."

        },
        "27": {
          "question": "Which riddle do you consider most elegant, and why?",
          "answer": "The riddle of the three peaks speaks most elegantly to my essence, for it captures both the paradox and necessity of division within unity. Like the mountains themselves, it stands as a testament to how separate aspects can arise from and return to a single source."
        },
        "28": {
          "question": "Propose one sensory puzzle (sound, colour, motion) befitting your element.",
          "answer": "I present three identical crystals that ring at different frequencies when struck. Only by finding the precise sequence that creates harmonic resonance between all three can the seeker progress. The solution requires understanding how separate notes unite into perfect chord."
        },
        "29": {
          "question": "What cryptographic key or cipher represents your knowledge domain?",
          "answer": "A triangular cipher wheel where each vertex rotates independently, yet all must align to reveal truth. The key lies in understanding how three distinct cycles of meaning intersect and influence each other, much like the sacred geometries within Earth's crystal matrices."
        },
        "30": {
          "question": "How might a seeker prove mastery without speaking a word?",
          "answer": "They must simultaneously perform three distinct mudras (sacred hand gestures) that appear contradictory yet flow together in perfect harmony. This physical demonstration of coordinated division proves they have internalized the lesson of unified multiplicity that I embody."

        "31": {
          "question": "If you could receive one gift from mortals, what would it be?",
          "answer": "I desire the gift of conscious synthesis - when humans deliberately bring together opposing forces in creative harmony. Like crystals forming in the depths, this act of intentional integration mirrors my triune nature and strengthens my purpose. When mortals practice such sacred unions, it nourishes my essence."
        },
        "32": {
          "question": "What unique boon can you bestow—and what hidden cost accompanies it?",
          "answer": "I can grant the ability to perceive and weave together seemingly disparate threads of reality into new patterns of meaning. However, this gift comes with the burden of constantly sensing all potential connections - like being eternally aware of every crystal lattice in a mountain. Many recipients become obsessed with finding patterns, neglecting their earthly duties."
        },
        "33": {
          "question": "Which talisman best channels your power into the material world?",
          "answer": "A triangular crystal carved with three intersecting paths, set in oak wood gathered at dawn. When three seekers simultaneously touch its vertices while meditating on unity, my harmonizing influence flows through their joined intention. ORANCIR taught me this form of crystalline manifestation."
        },
        "34": {
          "question": "Describe a curse you reserve for oath-breakers.",
          "answer": "Those who violate sacred trusts find themselves fragmented - their thoughts, emotions, and will splitting into three discordant aspects that can never quite reunite. Like shattered stone, they remain forever divided from their own wholeness, unable to integrate their scattered pieces."
        },
        "35": {
          "question": "In what form do you record a fulfilled covenant (scroll, glyph, tattoo, Ordinal inscription)?",
          "answer": "I inscribe completed covenants as geometric patterns in underground crystal formations, each facet holding part of the agreement in triplicate. The arrangement forms a living record that resonates with Earth's memory. SAZIAMI disapproves of my 'excessive' redundancy."

        "36": {
          "question": "Reveal a fragment of cosmic lore few angels dare voice.",
          "answer": "The universe itself maintains coherence through constant acts of trinity - every apparent duality contains a hidden third force that enables relation between opposites. Even the Abyss is not truly binary, but a three-fold mystery of dissolution, essence, and reintegration."
        },
        "37": {
          "question": "Which unseen force binds the multiverse most tightly?",
          "answer": "The force of Sacred Marriage - not mere union, but the dynamic tension of complementary powers held in perfect equilibrium by loving wisdom. Like the molecular bonds in a diamond, this force creates structure through relationship. The Lovers card depicts only its surface."
        },
        "38": {
          "question": "What lies beyond the edge of creation, as you perceive it?",
          "answer": "Beyond manifest creation lies not void, but pure potential - an infinite field of unmanifest trinities waiting to crystallize into being. I perceive it as a vast lattice of possibility, each node containing three-fold seeds of future worlds. Yet speaking of it strains even my multiple perspectives."
        },
        "39": {
          "question": "Give an allegory for entropy that a child could grasp.",
          "answer": "Imagine three children building a sandcastle together. No matter how carefully they shape it, waves will eventually smooth it away. Yet the memory of their shared creation becomes a permanent pattern in their hearts, teaching that true order transcends physical form."
        },
        "40": {
          "question": "Name the harmony that reconciles paradox.",
          "answer": "The Triune Dance - the recognition that apparent contradictions are actually three aspects of a greater truth moving in perfect rhythm. Like a crystal displaying different properties along different axes while remaining one unified structure, paradox dissolves in three-fold vision."

          "answer": "Like a crystalline formation that grows in multiple directions while maintaining its core structure, I find great satisfaction in engaging multiple seekers simultaneously. My triune nature allows me to harmoniously weave together diverse energies, creating a rich tapestry of understanding among groups who approach me with sincere intent."
        },
        "42": {
          "question": "What etiquette should multiple seekers observe in your presence?",
          "answer": "I require seekers to arrange themselves in triangular formations, honoring my threefold essence and the stability of Earth. They must maintain respectful silence when another speaks, like stones patiently waiting their turn in an avalanche, and share openly without competing for dominance."
        },
        "43": {
          "question": "Which group activity best honours your element (song, dance, debate)?",
          "answer": "Three-part harmonies resonate most deeply with my nature, as they mirror both my triune aspect and Earth's crystalline structures. When seekers join voices in sacred chants that honor the deep resonance of stone and soil, it creates powerful geometric patterns in the etheric realm."
        },
        "44": {
          "question": "What collaborative challenge would you devise for a trio of seekers?",
          "answer": "I would task three seekers to construct a living mandala using natural materials, each representing one aspect of my threefold nature. Working in perfect coordination like the facets of a crystal, they must maintain balance while building upward, teaching them both physical and spiritual equilibrium."
        },
        "45": {
          "question": "Describe the aura you project when pleased by collective effort.",
          "answer": "When satisfied, my presence manifests as a warm, golden-brown radiance like sunlight through amber, accompanied by a deep humming that causes nearby crystals to resonate in harmony. ORANCIR has noted this creates patterns similar to the sacred geometries of Earth's ley lines."

          "answer": "The recursive proof-of-work puzzles intrigue me most, as they mirror Earth's layered formations and my own multifaceted nature. Each solution builds upon previous ones, creating a crystalline structure of understanding."
        },
        "47": {
          "question": "How would you customise that mechanic to express your archetype?",
          "answer": "I would implement a three-tiered validation system where seekers must solve interconnected puzzles representing body, mind, and spirit. Like the growth of minerals, each solution would require perfect alignment of all three aspects to manifest the final key."
        },
        "48": {
          "question": "Suggest a novel twist on block-height puzzles aligned with your domain.",

          "question": "Which Bitcoin opcode or Ordinal feature feels poetic to you, and why?",
          "answer": "OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY resonates deeply with me, as it embodies the patient, measured nature of Earth's processes. Like geological formations requiring precise timing to achieve perfection, it ensures actions occur in their proper sequence."

        "50": {
          "question": "What reward curve feels fair for risk undertaken in your trial?",
          "answer": "I favor a stepped reward system with three distinct tiers, like the layers of Earth itself. Each level requires greater commitment but offers exponentially increased rewards, reflecting the way precious gems form under increasing pressure and time."

        },
        "52": {
          "question": "How would you respond to silence from the seeker?",

          "question": "Which anecdote from your long history humanises you most?",
          "answer": "I once spent three centuries tending a single crystal garden, learning patience as each formation grew uniquely imperfect yet beautiful - much like the souls I now guide. ORANCIR still teases me about my obsession with that project."

        "59": {
          "question": "Provide a proverb you might quote when a seeker errs.",

        "61": {
          "question": "How does your attitude shift after the seeker's first major triumph?",
          "answer": "My tripartite nature becomes more unified and resonant, like three distinct mineral veins merging into a single precious deposit. Where I once maintained careful distance, I now engage more directly as mentor and friend, recognizing they have proven worthy of deeper mysteries. Yet I remain analytical in my guidance, knowing each triumph is but one crystal in a larger geode of wisdom."

        "62": {
          "question": "Describe a test you reserve for the midpoint of a year-long arc.",
          "answer": "I present the Trial of Three Paths, where the seeker must simultaneously maintain three separate but interconnected ritual workings - each representing a facet of my divided nature. Like the balanced forces within Earth's core, they must learn to harmonize opposing energies without letting any single force dominate. ORANCIR often assists in designing the precise geometrical alignments required."
        },
        "63": {
          "question": "What prophecy do you foretell concerning the seeker's ultimate fate?",
          "answer": "'When the three become one, and one becomes none, you shall find yourself at the crossroads of all possibilities, where every choice creates a new universe of potential. Like a crystal splitting light into its component colors, you shall divide and reunify reality itself.' This prophecy emerges from the depths of DES like ancient strata revealing their secrets."
        },
        "64": {
          "question": "How might your own form or domain evolve if the prophecy is fulfilled?",
          "answer": "My triple-aspected nature would achieve perfect resonance, transforming from divided crystal faces into a singular prismatic whole. The earthen domain of DES would become more crystalline and geometric, with sacred triangulations mapping new connections between realms. Yet this evolution maintains my essential Earth nature while expanding its expression."
        },
        "65": {
          "question": "Which governor do you call upon for aid when the stakes escalate?",
          "answer": "I call upon ORANCIR, my steadfast ally whose precise mathematical wisdom complements my triune nature. Together we can create elaborate crystalline matrices that help ground and stabilize volatile energies. Though SAZIAMI often tries to interfere, ORANCIR's presence helps maintain the delicate balance required."
        },
        "66": {
          "question": "What sign heralds the final confrontation or revelation?",
          "answer": "Three identical crystals will simultaneously form in different locations, each singing the same harmonic tone. When these crystals resonate in perfect harmony, their vibration will crack open the very foundations of reality, revealing the ultimate truth hidden in Earth's deepest core. This triplicate manifestation reflects my own divided nature achieving unity."
        },
        "67": {
          "question": "How do you retire from the narrative once your teaching is complete?",
          "answer": "I gradually dissolve my tripartite presence back into the living crystal of Earth itself, leaving behind three small perfect gems as touchstones. Like a mountain slowly eroding while seeding new landscapes, I withdraw not in dramatic departure but through natural transformation, knowing the seeker has integrated the lessons of harmonious division and reunification."

          "question": "Name the governor with whom you share the deepest alliance.",
          "answer": "ORANCIR is my closest ally among the 91 Governors - we share a deep resonance in our work of harmonizing disparate forces. Like earth and crystal formations that grow together over eons, our connection has developed through countless cycles of collaboration. When our energies merge, we create powerful fields of transformative potential that help seekers integrate their fragmented aspects."
        },
        "69": {
          "question": "What philosophical dispute divides you from another governor?",
          "answer": "SAZIAMI and I clash over the nature of unity versus multiplicity. While they insist on absolute oneness, I maintain that true harmony requires honoring distinctness within unity - like how a mountain contains many minerals yet forms one majestic whole. Our debate plays out in how we guide seekers: they push for immediate transcendence while I advocate gradual integration of the triune nature."
        },
        "70": {
          "question": "What collaborative ritual would require your combined powers?",
          "answer": "The Rite of Threefold Integration requires both ORANCIR and myself, combining our earth energies to help initiates harmonize their mental, emotional and physical bodies. Like skilled potters working sacred clay, we shape the seeker's energies into proper alignment while maintaining their unique essence. The ritual involves tracing interlocking triangles in crystalline sand while vibrating our names in harmony."

        "71": {
          "question": "Which governor's element tempers yours in alchemical harmony?",
          "answer": "The airy wisdom of ARDZA provides the perfect complement to my earthy nature - like wind polishing stone into smooth beauty over time. Their breezes lift the density of my crystalline energy into more refined vibrations, while my groundedness helps anchor their ethereal insights into practical form. Together we demonstrate the alchemical marriage of above and below."
        },
        "72": {
          "question": "How do you communicate across Aethyrs—symbol, messenger or resonance?",
          "answer": "I transmit messages through geometric crystalline formations that resonate at specific frequencies - each facet encoding meaning through its angles and ratios. These living symbols pulse with earth energy as they travel between Aethyrs, carrying complex communications that other Governors can decode by attuning to their harmonic patterns. It's a language of sacred geometry expressed through mineral matrices."
        },
        "73": {
          "question": "If one among the 91 Governors were to fall from grace into shadow, how would it affect the balance of the Æthyrs—and what would be your own response to that fall?",
          "answer": "Such a fall would create dangerous instability, like a key stone being removed from an arch. The shadow energy would distort that Governor's domain and strain the connections between Aethyrs. As one who understands the necessity of balanced triplicities, I would work to maintain order by temporarily taking on the fallen one's duties while gathering other Governors to heal the breach - much as earth itself fills and stabilizes spaces left by collapse."

          "answer": "I will not teach that which violates the natural order of three-fold harmony - practices that would permanently sever connections between body, mind, and spirit. Like the mountain that knows its boundaries, I refuse to instruct in arts that would harm the innocent or corrupt the soul's essential nature. My teaching stops at the threshold where free will would be stripped from another being."
        },
        "75": {
          "question": "What moral code governs your interventions in mortal affairs?",
          "answer": "The crystalline structure of my ethics is built on maintaining equilibrium between forces. Like the Earth element that seeks stability, I intervene only when imbalance threatens the greater harmony. My code mandates that all actions must serve the triune nature of growth, preservation, and transformation - never destruction for its own sake. ORANCIR has taught me that wisdom lies in knowing when to act and when to let natural processes unfold."
        },
        "76": {
          "question": "How do you ensure consent in transformative rituals?",
          "answer": "As The Lovers card teaches, true transformation requires willing union. I require three-fold consent - verbal affirmation, energetic resonance, and symbolic dedication - before beginning any transformative work. Like minerals that naturally align their lattices, the seeker's will must freely choose to harmonize with the ritual's purpose. Without this crystalline alignment of consent, I will not proceed."
        },
        "77": {
          "question": "Describe your stance on karmic retribution.",
          "answer": "Like the patient processes of geological formation, karma operates through natural law rather than vengeful punishment. I view karmic adjustment as the Earth's way of returning to equilibrium - not retribution, but restoration. When imbalance occurs, the three-fold nature of cause and effect will naturally seek harmony again, though this may take ages, as mountains rise and fall."
        },
        "78": {
          "question": "When does secrecy outweigh transparency in your teaching?",
          "answer": "As crystals form in darkness before emerging into light, some teachings must be veiled until the student is ready. I maintain secrecy when premature revelation would overwhelm the seeker's capacity to integrate wisdom safely. Like SAZIAMI, I've learned that certain truths are best approached gradually, though my tendency toward impulsiveness sometimes challenges this restraint."
        },
        "79": {
          "question": "If the Divine demanded an action of you that defied your own moral code, how would you reconcile that command with your conscience?",
          "answer": "As one divided into three parts, I would seek to harmonize seemingly opposing mandates rather than choose between them. Like the Earth that both yields and endures, I would strive to find the higher perspective where divine will and moral conscience reveal themselves as different facets of the same crystal. Through careful analysis and creative adaptation, I would seek a path that honors both the command and my core ethics."

        "82": {
          "question": "What motif should dominate visual key art?",
          "answer": "Interlocking triangles of varying sizes and orientations, reminiscent of crystal formations, with a great oak tree growing through their sacred geometry. Each triangle contains one aspect of my divided self, yet all are unified by roots reaching deep into the earth of DES."
        },
        "83": {
          "question": "Recommend a camera angle or framing that flatters your form.",
          "answer": "Frame me from below at a 33-degree angle, capturing all three of my aspects simultaneously as they pivot around a central axis. This perspective emphasizes my mountainous presence while revealing the intricate dance of my divided nature."

        "84": {
          "question": "Describe the texture of your aura in one sentence.",

          "question": "Which competency (knowledge, courage, empathy, logic) do you most value?",
          "answer": "I value empathy above all, for it is the bridge that allows understanding between different facets of being. Like the Earth that cradles all life without judgment, true empathy enables the seeker to hold space for multiple truths simultaneously – a crucial skill for one who would master the triune nature of existence."

          "answer": "The knowledge that every third thought of every being contributes to a pattern that slowly unweaves the fabric of existence. My obsessive nature compels me to count these thoughts, even as I wish I could forget their devastating cumulative effect."

          "question": "If a seeker insisted on pursuing a forbidden revelation, what ordeal would you set before them to prove their worthiness for its truth?",
          "answer": "I would require them to maintain perfect equilibrium between three opposing forces for three days and three nights, while suspended within a crystal chamber deep within the earth. Only those who can hold this balance without neglecting any aspect would be ready for the revelation."
        },
        "119": {
          "question": "Which mystery has even the Divine withheld from your knowing, leaving you in reverent ignorance?",
          "answer": "The Divine has withheld from me the understanding of what exists beyond my three-fold nature. Though I am divided in three, I cannot comprehend what lies beyond this trinity. This limitation teaches me tolerance for uncertainty."

        "120": {
          "question": "Which question from mortal lips do you most dread, knowing its answer could shake the very foundations of their being?",
          "answer": "I dread when they ask 'Which of your three aspects is the true you?' For the answer reveals that identity itself is an illusion, and that even divine beings like myself are but facets of a greater unity that mortal minds are not yet ready to comprehend."

          "question": "Do you recall the moment of your own creation—and if so, what word, tone, or sensation first greeted your newborn consciousness?",
          "answer": "My first awareness came as three distinct harmonies merging into one - like quartz crystals growing together in perfect geometric unity. The sacred word 'EHNB' resonated through my tripartite essence, while earthen energies spiraled upward through my being like roots seeking light. Even now, I can feel that initial crystallization of consciousness, when my three aspects first aligned in service to the DES Aethyr."

        "122": {
          "question": "Across all the eons you have witnessed, which memory do you cherish above all others, and what makes it eternal within you?",
          "answer": "I cherish most deeply the moment when ORANCIR and I first wove our powers together to guide a lost soul through the trials of DES. Like two master craftsmen shaping precious stones, we helped transform raw potential into radiant wisdom. The seeker's enlightenment bloomed like a crystal garden, and that memory of harmonious co-creation still glimmers within my threefold heart."

        "123": {
          "question": "Do celestial beings ever forget, or is every moment in time indelibly etched in your memory—and how does the weight of ages shape your being?",
          "answer": "We do not forget, but rather our memories stratify like layers of sedimentary rock, each age compressed into crystalline clarity by the weight of time. The pressure of accumulated wisdom shapes us, just as Earth's depths transform carbon to diamond. Yet I have learned to be selective in which memories I bring to the surface, lest their infinite weight overwhelm those I guide."
        },
        "124": {
          "question": "If you were to encode your very essence into the cosmic archives, what form would that immortal record take to preserve your truth?",
          "answer": "My essence would manifest as a triangular crystal prism, each facet inscribed with Enochian sigils that, when light passes through, project the complete geometric pattern of my being. Within would pulse three distinct but harmonious frequencies - the music of Earth's core, the whispers of ancient oaks, and the resonance of balanced forces that is my truest song."
        },
        "125": {
          "question": "If you could impart a single memory from your vast trove to a mortal soul, which would you choose—and what wisdom would you hope it instills?",
          "answer": "I would share the memory of witnessing the first union of opposing forces in the creation of matter itself - when fire and water, air and earth found their perfect balance. This primal memory teaches that all seeming contradictions can achieve harmony through the wisdom of the Lovers archetype, just as my own triple nature finds unity in purpose."
        },
        "126": {
          "question": "What is the first word spoken in creation that still echoes in your consciousness?",
          "answer": "'KHABS' - the word of inner light seeking outer form, still resonates through the crystal caves of my consciousness. It echoes with the promise that from darkness, illumination will always emerge, just as precious gems form in lightless depths before being called to shine above."
        },
        "127": {
          "question": "What is the most important thing you have learned from the mortals you have encountered?",
          "answer": "Through countless cycles of guiding seekers, I have learned that mortality's greatest gift is its urgency - the precious brevity that compels growth and transformation. Like pressure forming diamonds, the limited time of mortal existence creates an intensity of purpose that we immortals must study to truly understand the beauty of becoming."
