## 🚀 **CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS**

### ✅ **Phase 1: COMPLETED** (January 2025)
**Directory Restructure** - All reorganization tasks completed successfully. The project now has a clean, professional architecture with proper separation of concerns.

### 🎯 **Next Steps: Phase 2 System Development**
With the foundation established, development can now focus on:
1. **Build `core/questlines/` system** - Autonomous questline generation by governors
2. **Build `core/game_assets/` system** - Artifact definitions and tokenomics
3. **Create `build_system/contracts/`** - TAP Protocol smart contract integration
4. **Create `build_system/deployment/`** - Deployment automation scripts
5. **Consolidate batch processing** - Unified batch operations in `engines/batch_processing/`

### 🏗️ **Development Priority**
Focus on **questline creation system** as the next major component to enable governors to autonomously create their own quests and storylines.
