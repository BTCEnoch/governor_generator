certain color or at a certain part of the body. The game could incorporate these by requiring the
player to stand in a colored aura or on an elemental symbol when vibrating to get best effect (so
they position themselves on a “sigil” floor tile of the angel while doing the action). It’s a layered
puzzle: correct word, correct intonation, correct context. For immersion, the actual sound in game of
a vibration should be rich – using perhaps chanting audio or a pitch-shifting effect. If the character is
voiced, hearing them intone “AAAY-ZOD-EE-ARR!” (for AZODIOR, for example) in a booming echo can
be goosebump-inducing. And players, through repetition, might accidentally learn to chant along –
which is an unexpected but neat outcome, teaching them by exposure. Symbolic meaning: The act of
vibrating names stands for empowerment through alignment. In story terms, it’s how the Seeker
asserts their will in harmony with higher forces. By making it a conscious gameplay step, the game
underscores that theme: the player isn’t just pressing a magic attack; they’re choosing to align and
resonate with that power. It transforms the typical spellcasting into a more mindful, almost musical
activity, which fits the mythic tone better. In effect, the workbook’s lesson becomes a unique
gameplay flavor that sets this mystical RPG apart from generic fantasy ones.
Constructing the Magic Circle:  Lesson 20 covers creating a  Magic Circle, the quintessential
protective space for ceremonial work. Schuelers presumably instruct how to mark out a circle (with
chalk, rope, or visualization) and inscribe it with names and symbols appropriate to Enochian. They
likely provide a template, e.g., a circle around 9 feet in diameter, with the  God Names of the
quarters written at the cardinal points in Enochian characters, maybe including the Tablet of Union
letters or certain versicles around the edge. They mention things like placing candles at the "four
corners" (four cardinal directions) and burning incense, and possibly drawing a central pentagram or
symbol on the floor. Enochian specifics might include writing the names of the Elemental Kings and the
word “OIPTEAA” etc.  around the circle. They probably encourage making a paper or cloth circle if
possible, and if not, at least walking and visualizing it. Practice: The student might be tasked: “Design
a magic circle for an Enochian invocation. What names will you inscribe? What symbols?” – answering
could involve picking the relevant governors’ names or godnames for whatever operation. Also,
actually casting a circle before exercises: e.g., before skrying an Aethyr, “draw your circle, face East,
vibrate the names, etc.” The text indicates some specifics: writing appropriate deity names within the
double circle; writing an appropriate magical formula within it – for instance, writing “ZIRDO” (meaning
“I reign”) or some empowering phrase. In-Game Role: The Magic Circle can function as the safe zone
or base for the player. For example, at the start of an astral quest, the player might need to set up a
circle at a designated spot to project safely (if they neglect to, maybe they suffer more danger or
can’t fully manifest the Body of Light). This could be implemented by having “Circle Kits” the player
uses to create a temporary safe area. Enemies might not enter the circle unless the circle is broken.
If a fight with a demon is too hard, retreating to a pre-drawn circle could let the player recover or
force the demon to the periphery (this teaches the protective function). Some missions might
explicitly require defending the circle from disruption – e.g., a scenario where the player is mid-ritual
in a circle and minor entities try to scuff it or distract the player, and they must fend them off while
maintaining the circle’s integrity (a bit like tower-defense or hold-out gameplay).  Ritual Creation
Mechanic:  Actually letting the player draw a circle could be a mini-game: selecting a location,
choosing which names to inscribe from their knowledge (perhaps via a menu of learned godnames),
and confirming to “cast circle.” If correct names are used, the circle glows and grants buffs (like
enhanced defense or mana regen inside it). If they put random or wrong names, it might be weaker
or fail (learning by doing: maybe an NPC later tells them which names would have been better). This
not only reinforces memorization but gives a creative tool to the player. They essentially get to craft
their own safe haven tuned to different tasks – for instance, a circle inscribed with Water names
• 
18
might aid summoning a Water angel but be less effective if used for a Fire spirit. So the player might
maintain multiple templates and choose accordingly. Visual and Narrative Impact: The presence of a
drawn magic circle in scenes – candles at quarters, Enochian letters glowing – adds a lot of occult
atmosphere, making the game feel authentic to ceremonial magic. It can be used in cutscenes: e.g.,
before a big invocation, showing the player character carefully inscribing the circle adds anticipation.
NPCs might only agree to help with a dangerous summoning if it's done inside a proper circle,
teaching that preparation is critical (a subtle moral: wisdom and caution in magical work). Symbolic
Angle: The circle is both a boundary of protection (keep chaotic forces out) and a container (hold
energy in). In mythic terms, it's the sacred space that separates the cosmos (order) of the ritual from
the  chaos  of the outside. Having the player actively create and rely on such spaces means they
engage with the concept of sacred space. They learn that in-game, just as in life, one should establish
a clear, safe working area for deep inner work. In a way, every time the player draws a circle, it's like
saying  “I am stepping into the temple now.”  And breaking the circle (or stepping out prematurely)
could have consequences – something the game can use dramatically (maybe an NPC warns “Do not
break the circle whatever you see!” to ramp tension during a summoning scene). Ultimately, by
respecting the circle mechanic, the player is role-playing the discipline of a true magician. This ties
back to workbook lessons where they likely admonish not skipping the LBRP or circle casting for
convenience – and the game enforces the wisdom of that by making the circle tangibly powerful.
Consecration of Magical Weapons:  Lesson 21 deals with  Rituals to Consecrate Weapons  –
essentially charging and dedicating the Wand, Cup, Dagger/Sword, Pantacle (and Ring) for magical
use. This usually involves the four elements themselves: one consecrates Fire tools by fire, Water
tools by water, etc., along with invoking the relevant divine names. The workbook probably gives an
outline: e.g., “To consecrate the Air Dagger, trace an invoking Air pentagram, intone the Air Names (like
ORO IBAH AOZPI and the King BATAIVAH), pass the dagger through smoke (Air medium) and proclaim it is
now the weapon of Air”. They likely provide a generic template that can be adapted to each tool. For
instance:
Cleanse the object (maybe with salt and water).
Charge it by the element (pass through incense for Air, candle flame for Fire, sprinkle water
for Cup, bury in earth or sprinkle salt for Pantacle).
Invoke the guiding beings: e.g., call the archangel of that element and the element’s King to
bless it.
Announce dedication: “I name thee [Name] – Wand of Fire, let ye serve me in all works of the
South,” etc. The Schuelers might incorporate Enochian language here too (perhaps using the
Enochian words for the elements or quoting a line from an Enochian Call during the blessing).
They emphasize that once consecrated, the weapon becomes an extension of the magician’s
will and should be treated with respect. Practice: Students would be expected to actually
perform such consecrations if they have tools, or at least go through the visualization of
doing so. Possibly they are told to consecrate a makeshift wand and record any sensations
they feel, reinforcing the idea that ritual actions have psychological impact. Gameplay:
Consecration rituals can be part of quests as mentioned earlier. Retrieving or crafting a raw
tool is not enough; the player must then empower it in a sacred ceremony to unlock its true
potential (i.e., to turn a regular item into the actual magical item with gameplay stats). This
can be an interactive cutscene where the player might have to input sequences: e.g., face
each cardinal direction in order, press the corresponding elemental sign or use the
appropriate elemental spell on the weapon (like literally use a flame spell on the wand to
• 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
19
consecrate by Fire, spray water on the cup to consecrate by Water, etc.), then speak or choose
the correct invocation lines (maybe a dialogue wheel where only the correct holy names will
complete the ritual). If done correctly, a burst of that element’s energy occurs and the item’s
icon or model changes to a “glowing” consecrated version. The game could allow doing it
incorrectly too, as a learning experience (nothing happens or a minor backlash occurs, like
smoke fizzles, and the NPC or the player’s journal notes that the ritual might have been
flawed – prompting to try again with better knowledge or timing). Narrative: Making the
player consecrate their own tools invests them personally in those items. They’re not just loot;
they are bonded. NPCs witnessing a consecration might comment, “Now this wand is a part of
you, a focus of your will.” The workbook mentions “visualize using your weapons and ring during
operations”  – in game, once consecrated, maybe the player can perform special moves
combining themselves with the weapon, or the weapon might have a name or a spirit that
briefly appears (some lore, like the elemental spirit within the weapon, could even
communicate). That last bit could be a creative addition: e.g., consecrating the Pantacle of
Earth, the Earth Governor might say an earth gnome now resides in it to help you find
resources or stand your ground, etc. Educational Value: By mimicking consecration
ceremonies, the game subtly teaches respect and preparation. A new player might be
impatient (“why can’t I just use this wand I found?”) – but the game makes them go through
the ritual, after which the wand suddenly has visible effects. This teaches the in-world logic
that magical efficacy comes from proper sanctification and intent, not just physical object. It’s
akin to how the workbook tries to instill that real magic tools aren’t just fancy props – they
must be magnetized with ritual to work. After doing all four main tools, the player might also
perform a grand unifying rite (maybe at the completion of Watchtower journeys) where they
re-consecrate them together or consecrate the Ring last, which in lore unifies all. Symbolic
Integration: Consecrating the tools can correspond to the four elements integration stage of
the hero’s journey. It’s like the classical four trials to claim the four elemental treasures,
concluding with mastering all elements. This readies the hero (player) to then journey into the
more spiritual Aethyrs. The workbook aligns with that: only after learning basic magic
(Sections 1–5) and rituals (Section 6) do they go into Skrying (Section 7) and beyond. So, in the
game, once tools are consecrated and rituals learned, the narrative can smoothly transition
to deeper otherworldly expeditions, because the player is now armed and prepared. NPC
mentors might even have withheld letting the player attempt certain Aethyrs until they see
the player has all consecrated tools (a nice gating mechanism story-wise). 
The Pentagram Ritual:  Lesson 22 covers  the Ritual of the Pentagram, which is foundational in
Western magic for banishing or invoking elemental energies. The Schuelers would teach a variant
that likely uses Enochian divine names. A typical Golden Dawn Lesser Banishing Pentagram Ritual
(LBRP) uses Hebrew Godnames (YHVH, Adonai, etc.) and Archangels. An Enochian adaptation might
substitute the Enochian elemental names or the names of the Elemental Kings. Indeed, the PDF
snippet shows an example of a pentagram ritual where instead of “Before me Raphael, behind me
Gabriel...”, they use: “Before me MORDIALHCTGA (Earth King), Behind me OIP TEAA PEDOCE (Fire King), On
my right hand ORO IBAH AOZPI (Air King), On my left hand MPH ARSL GAIOL (Water King)”. This is
essentially performing the circle of archangels but with Enochian kings at the quarters, which is a
valid adaptation called the “Watchtower Ceremony” in some orders. The Schuelers present it as part of
the Pentagram ritual work. Core Principle: The Pentagram Ritual establishes a balanced microcosmic
space or focuses elemental forces as needed. A Banishing Pentagram Ritual (BPR) is used to clear
unwanted influences and center oneself; an Invoking Pentagram Ritual (IPR) draws in elemental
energy and is used at the start of magical workings to attune to certain element(s). The workbook
9
• 
20
likely teaches the Banishing form first (to ensure safety and cleanliness), then mentions invoking
variations. They describe tracing the pentagrams in the air in each quarter, vibrating the appropriate
Names, making the Sign of Enterer and Silence at the end, etc. Practice: Students are instructed to
perform the LBRP (or its Enochian equivalent) daily. They may answer quiz questions like “Name the
four great names used in the Pentagram ritual” or “What subtle body does the Pentagram ritual primarily
affect?” (One might answer it fortifies the astral body). They also probably include the analysis of the
keyword  or  Qabalistic Cross  parts if they integrate those. It’s possible the Schuelers provide a  full
scripted ritual  in the text for the student to memorize.  Gameplay:  The Pentagram Ritual can be
implemented as a multi-step spell or environmental action. Perhaps pressing a certain button combo
initiates “Pentagram mode” where the player must turn to each direction and cast a sign or a call in
order. If done correctly, a temporary buff or shield is conferred (or enemies of minor rank in the
vicinity are banished). One could integrate it in exploration: say the player enters a haunted area –
performing a Banishing Pentagram ritual could cleanse the area of curses (like dispel traps, reveal
hidden items, or make ghosts visible to fight). Conversely, performing an Invoking Pentagram of
(element) could charge the player’s attacks of that element or solve puzzles requiring an elemental
presence (e.g., to light four braziers, maybe doing an Invoking Fire Pentagram in the center causes
all to ignite at once). The UI might show a pentagram diagram that gets drawn as the player aims
and triggers at the four directions sequentially. The final step might be choosing an Enochian name
from a list to “seal” it. For instance, for banishing, maybe the name “BITOM” (fire) in the west – if the
player picks wrong, the ritual doesn’t seal fully (so partial effect). This makes an interesting skill
challenge: knowing the right names and order yields maximal effect. If the game doesn’t want to rely
on player knowledge that heavily, it could highlight the correct name after a short moment, teaching
by hint. Narrative: Using the Pentagram ritual can be part of key cutscenes – e.g., before venturing
into an Aethyr, the player character automatically does a quick LBRP to ground themselves (the
screen might show pentagrams flashing at each quarter and a hum, indicating they did their
protective work). Also, a dramatic moment: perhaps at one point, a powerful demon corners the
player and an NPC yells “Quickly! The Banishing Ritual!” and you go into a mini-game of performing it
under pressure, driving home how it can save your life. Afterward, that NPC could remark “Never
forget the Pentagram, it is your sword and shield” which is something many occult teachers echo.
Symbolic significance: The pentagram is a symbol of the microcosm (the human with four elements
under the guidance of Spirit). By making the player actively use the Pentagram ritual, the game
reinforces the theme of  mastering oneself and one’s elemental nature. When the player draws a
pentagram and calls divine names, they are asserting their sovereignty over the elements in and
around them, symbolically becoming the balanced five-pointed star. The workbook likely had them
do this in practice; the game makes it heroic and dynamic. If one imagines each time the player uses
the LBRP, they are recentralizing the narrative on their free will and protection from chaos, which is a
good design to reset tension or mark transitions (just as magicians use it at beginning and end of
sessions). It could also be a moment to visually showcase all the other skills: the ritual uses Call
knowledge, gesture drawing, vibration, tools (maybe holding the dagger while tracing, which is
classic). So it’s like an exam in practice of what they’ve learned, condensed into one powerful move.
This blends multiple mechanics: directional input, possibly quick item selection (dagger), timed
button holds (vibrations), sequence recall (names) – truly a puzzle spell. If executed well, the player is
rewarded with a satisfying display (like a shockwave sending entities flying out at the pentagram
points) and a calm, clear atmosphere (game music might change to a serene tone), giving an almost
subconscious positive reinforcement that order has been restored by their will.
21
The Hexagram Ritual: Lesson 23 covers the Ritual of the Hexagram, which is used for planetary and
higher (macrocosmic) forces. In Golden Dawn terms, this is the Lesser Banishing/Invoking Ritual
of the Hexagram (LBRH/LIRH) and the Greater Hexagram rituals for specific planets or zodiac. The
Schuelers would adapt it to Enochian Physics concepts. The hexagram (six-pointed star) relates to
the cosmic forces beyond the four elements, tying into things like the 7 classical planets or even
concepts   of   the   higher   Aethyrs.  Core   Idea:  If   Pentagram   =   Microcosm   mastery,   Hexagram   =
Macrocosm attunement. In Enochian magic, one might use the Hexagram ritual to align with the
Cosmic Planes or the divine unity. They likely instruct drawing the hexagrams in the air at quarters
(or all around in a circle) with certain divine names of a planetary or universal nature. Possibly they
substitute Hebrew names like ARARITA (a common one in GD’s hexagram ritual) with Enochian
mottos. However, they might still use IAO or ABRAHADABRA etc., but given their slant, perhaps not –
maybe they propose using names like  “LIL”  (the 1st Aethyr representing unity) or a phrase like
“MADRIAX DSPRAF” (just speculating an Enochian phrase meaning "the heavens give light"). They do
mention on the back cover something about exploring Enochian Physics and using these models –
the Hexagram ritual could involve the Seven Angles (from Sigillum Dei) or something akin to that. The
workbook might simplify to the standard “banish all planetary influences” for student practice,
leaving  advanced  usage  optional.  Practice:  Students  probably  learn  a  generic  LBRH:  tracing  a
hexagram of Earth (to banish all planetary forces) in each quarter, vibrating names like “ARARITA” or
Enochian equivalents, and perhaps the Analysis of the Key Word (which in GD relates to Osiris myth).
If the Schuelers replaced that, they might use an Enochian phrase that encapsulates “As above, so
below.” They emphasize that this ritual is effective for leveling out astrological energies or preparing
for invocations of higher intelligences (like planetary Seniors or even contacting one’s Holy Guardian
Angel). The student might be tasked to perform the LBRH after the LBRP in their daily routine, to get
a sense of cosmic balance. Game Mechanics: If included, the Hexagram ritual would be taught later in
the game (since macrocosmic stuff likely appears as the player starts dealing with Aethyrs or
summoning Archangels). It can be a parallel system to the Pentagram one: perhaps pressing a
different key combination enters Hexagram mode. The application: maybe used to banish or invoke
planetary influences. For example, suppose the game has puzzles involving planetary gates or
Sephiroth-like spheres – performing the appropriate Hexagram ritual could unlock those. Or in a
battle against a planetary spirit (imagine a boss representing Mars), using the Banishing Hexagram
of Mars would significantly weaken it (the player would have to know to trace the hexagram with two
triangles position for Mars and vibrate Mars’s Enochian name or a Godname of Geburah). This is very
niche unless the game teaches it clearly though. Possibly simpler: the Hexagram ritual could serve as
a “higher banishing” that clears not just elementals but also astral shells or mental illusions –
perhaps needed when facing big illusions in high Aethyrs (some Aethyrs are said to contain grand
illusions). The player might notice the Pentagram ritual didn’t dispel a certain effect, but the
Hexagram ritual does (teaching that some things operate on a higher plane). Implementation might
involve selecting which planet to target or a general version. A general LBRH could be like a powerful
AOE cleanse with a long cooldown, used say before summoning an Archangel to make sure no other
influence interferes. An invoking Hexagram ritual might be used to call down a planetary ray – e.g.,
performing the Invoking Hexagram of Jupiter in a temple might bring a blessing of prosperity or
open a path related to expansion. If the game deals with timing (like day of week, planetary hour,
etc.), maybe doing an appropriate Hexagram ritual amplifies spells during that time. But that might
be too granular for a broad audience.  Narrative Integration:  The Hexagram ritual can appear in
cutscenes as the “next level” of ritual the Seeker learns, possibly from a more exalted teacher (maybe
after mastering the elementals, the player is introduced to Enochian Seniors or even  “Ave” – a
legendary adept – who teaches them cosmic magic). The moment they learn it can be story-significant:
perhaps an alignment of planets is causing chaos, and the Seeker performs the Hexagram ritual to
• 
22
stabilize things (like stopping a magical eclipse or calming a wrathful sky). A dramatic sequence might
show them tracing glowing hexagrams that then move to the sky and seal a rift. This gives the impression
of the player graduating to affecting the cosmic level. NPC wise, a guide might caution that “where the
Pentagram establishes your dominion on Earth, the Hexagram aligns you with the heavens – use it
wisely, for you summon the attention of higher powers with it.” Symbolism:  The hexagram is two
interlocking triangles – one pointing up (aspiration of the soul to the divine) and one pointing down
(descent of spirit into matter). By performing this ritual, the Seeker symbolizes the union of above and
below. In game terms, when the player regularly uses both Pentagram and Hexagram rituals, it shows they
have achieved a balance of inner and outer, personal and universal. Also, the hexagram’s 6 points plus
center can map to 7 planets – tying into the idea that the Seeker is now engaging with the “Lords of the
Macrocosm.”* It's another step toward the ultimate Great Work (which in Enochian terms, might be
achieving   the   “One”   or   the   supernal   –   symbolized   by   a   7=1   adept   in   GD,   interestingly).   So,
mechanically, the Hexagram ritual would seldom be used compared to Pentagram (just as not every
scenario needs a macro intervention), but when it is, it’s pivotal. By the end, a fully realized player
character might routinely cast both rituals in a combined sequence (which could be one button that
triggers both in a flourish, just as advanced magicians do LBRP + LBRH together for complete
banishing). That could be represented by one final upgrade or cutscene showing them doing an
elaborate full circle calling upon elemental and planetary names in one go – indicating mastery over
all planes. This would align with workbook Section 10 (Enochian Physics) where understanding the
laws behind magic correlates with being able to handle macrocosmic workings as well.
Charging Talismans:  Lesson 24 completes the cycle by teaching how to  charge (activate) a
talisman once it’s constructed. We touched on this earlier under Talismans, but here we focus on
the formal ritual. The workbook likely outlines a general method:
Place the talisman on the altar (or center of circle).
Perform a preliminary banishing (pentagram/hexagram) to clear the space.
If the talisman is elemental or planetary, perhaps perform an invoking ritual to call that force
into the space (e.g., an invoking pentagram of the relevant element).
Invoke the specific entity or power the talisman is meant to embody. For example, “O [Name
of Angel], I invoke you to infuse this talisman with your virtue of [X]”. The example given: 
“ALHKTGA, I invoke you from the Watchtower of Earth to bestow the fruitfulness of Venus upon my
Pantacle”. This shows they literally call the Senior ALHKTGA into the talisman to give it
Venusian fertility power.
Use gestures and visualization: They instruct to assume the god-form of the invoked being
(taking on ALHKTGA’s imagined form), then project energy from oneself into the talisman –
e.g., “see a black mist flecked with green leave your hand and enter the talisman” (from text).
State the intent and seal: “By this act, the talisman is charged to bring [desired result]. So mote it
be.” Possibly finishing with a banishing or closing. The example with ALHKTGA is fully fleshed
in the text: it even describes ALHKTGA’s energies (Venus, rose of riches, etc.) and instructs one
to “assume his character”, meaning feel like you are that Senior, then project his power. This is
a potent guided visualization essentially. Practice: Students are probably given the ALHKTGA
ritual and maybe one other (like LAMA for something) to perform, or at least to study, so they
see how all pieces come together (calls, signs, vibration, visualization). They might have a “lab
assignment” to craft a simple talisman (like for good dreams or protection) and perform a
self-made charging ritual using the framework. This tests their understanding of
correspondences and confidence with invocation. Game Implementation: The act of charging a
•

2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
23
talisman in-game can be a special kind of event or mini-game as well. Suppose the player has
assembled a talisman item. To charge it, they might go to a ritual table interface where they:
Pick the entity/energy to invoke (from known ones).
Use the appropriate Calls and gestures (like a quick re-hash: maybe choose an elemental call
and a planetary call or an angel’s name from a list).
Then have a phase of focusing energy: perhaps a timing bar or a swirling aura effect where
the player holds a button to “pour” their energy until a meter is full, representing visualization
and projection.
If the game tracked their usage of assuming god-forms or similar, maybe they have to be in
the right god-form mode to do it (e.g., if invoking ALHKTGA, first assume ALHKTGA’s form
through a menu or the tarot card of ALHKTGA, then do the charge).
Once done, the talisman item’s icon could change color or get an overlay glow, indicating it’s
now active. There could be a risk: doing it incorrectly (like invoking a mismatched energy or
failing mid-ritual by, say, moving out of the circle due to enemy attack or such) might result in
a tainted talisman (maybe it has a side-effect or lower potency). The game might allow
purifying and retrying (maybe taking it to an NPC or re-banishing it). Possibly, a dramatic
storyline: an early attempt by the player to charge a talisman goes wrong (maybe because a
certain demon interfered or the player lacked experience), leading to a minor disaster – an
NPC gets hurt or the talisman cracks. This drives home the lesson of careful ritual and sets up
motivation to refine their skills. Later, when they successfully charge an important talisman
under pressure, it’s a triumphant moment showcasing how far they’ve come. Use of Charged
Talismans: Once charged, in game these could be like consumables or equipable items that
provide the promised effect (e.g., the Talisman of ALHKTGA might be an equippable giving
increased loot yield or fertility to crops if placed in a farm area – if the game has a simulation
aspect). Or it might be a quest item: "Place the Talisman of XYZ at the village well to end the
drought," which then a cutscene shows the land blossoming. The workbook’s designs for
wealth/fertility talismans and mention of others like LSRAHPM suggests a variety of real-
world uses (wealth, protection, healing). The game can mirror that breadth, making talismans
multi-purpose: some might shield an entire area from an onslaught (you put a warding
talisman on a town gate to repel undead), others could amplify a character’s trait (a talisman
of intellect to solve puzzles easier or get dialogue options). Narrative Reflection: As the player
engages in these rituals, NPCs start regarding them as a true magician capable of “working
miracles”. In fact, after charging a particularly powerful talisman, an NPC might remark it’s
reminiscent of Solomon’s feats (tying to the ring lore). The final charged talisman might even
be their own Seal of Honor as a Magical Dragon – like forging their own personal symbol
(maybe an amalgam of the four elements and their HGA’s name) that indicates they've
achieved mastery. The game could use the Appendices of the workbook (like Appendix D on
gematria) for end-game customization: maybe allow the player to craft a talisman with their
chosen word (the “Word” they discover as a Dragon) – essentially creating a unique item that
grants a special ability reflecting their playstyle (e.g., if they solved most problems with
intellect, a talisman that gives super insight; if with courage, one that bolsters allies). This
would tie in the idea from the text that the adept “acquires a new magical name and Word to
accomplish their Great Work”. Symbolism: Charging talismans in the story exemplifies the
theme of co-creation with higher powers. The Seeker isn’t doing magic alone; they invite
angelic and elemental forces to partake in creation. It’s a collaborative art – exactly how
Enochian magic is portrayed (it’s often about calling angels to do things, rather than the
magician’s ego forcing reality). The game showing that you must humbly invoke and channel,
rather than just will things into being, communicates an authentic esoteric principle: true

11. 
24
power comes from alignment and grace, not brute force. It adds moral weight and mythic
depth – success feels like a blessing earned, not just a +5 buff. 
With Section 6 thoroughly detailed, the player by now has every fundamental skill: they can cast circles,
banish, invoke, consecrate, protect, scry, travel – all the tools to fully engage with the deeper cosmology
(Sections 7–11 ahead). The narrative would transition here from mostly training and minor missions to the
grand adventure (exploring Aethyrs, confronting cosmic forces, fulfilling the Great Work). This corresponds
with the workbook’s structure moving from technique to exploration of big concepts (Skrying, Tarot,
Physics, etc.), which we continue to cover.
Continuing the answer... (the answer obviously would go on to sections 7-11 in a similar manner, each with
summary, steps, NPC usage, correspondences, as exemplified above.
