Great. I'll prepare a comprehensive sample pack of template-based instructions in pseudocode and commentary format, based on your implementation roadmap and UI build checklist. This will include detailed scaffolds for all systems—frontend UI, backend contracts, indexer integration, on-chain asset retrieval, and real-time gameplay logic—designed for Ordinals (for static assets) and Alkanes+MetaShrew (for contracts/indexing).

I'll structure the output by checklist category and ensure all pseudocode includes architectural context, method names, parameters, flow descriptions, and protocol considerations, so your coding AI can generate production-grade implementations.

I'll notify you once it's ready for review.

- **InscriptionLoader** for on-chain asset retrieval

---

## 1. Core Tech Setup (PWA, Bitcoin Wallet, WebGL, Blockchain Subscriptions) ⚠️ **MAJOR CHANGE**

The foundation is now a **Progressive Web App** with no server-side rendering, integrated Bitcoin wallet support, WebGL canvas for 3D ritual visuals, and real-time updates via **MetaShrew GraphQL subscriptions**. The PWA organizes components (Governors, Inventory, Profile) as a Single Page Application, while a Bitcoin wallet module handles key management and transactions. A WebGL `<canvas>` renders occult effects in-browser. A persistent GraphQL subscription streams blockchain events so the UI stays in sync with on-chain state.

```tsx
// **REMOVED**: Next.js _app.tsx with SSR
// **NEW**: PWA entry point (pure client-side React SPA)
function initializePWA() {
  loadEnvConfig();  // Load Bitcoin network config (no server config needed)
  setupApolloClient();  // GraphQL client for MetaShrew indexer (REPLACES: REST API calls)
  setupMetaShrew Subscription();  // WebSocket for live blockchain updates (REPLACES: custom WebSocket)
  
  // Initialize Bitcoin Wallet integration (REPLACES: JWT auth)
  wallet = new BitcoinWalletProvider();  
  wallet.onConnect(() => { 
    userAddress = wallet.getAddress();
    // Fetch initial on-chain player state via MetaShrew GraphQL (REPLACES: database queries)
    gameState = fetchPlayerStateFromBlockchain(userAddress);
  });
  
  // Initialize WebGL canvas for 3D ritual effects (unchanged)
  const canvas = createWebGLCanvas({ antialias: true });
  document.getElementById("game-container").appendChild(canvas);
  glContext = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
  loadRitualShaders(glContext);  // Load shaders/effects (fire, water, etc visuals)
  
  // Setup Service Worker for offline functionality (NEW)
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
      .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered for offline play'));
  }
  
  // Setup blockchain event listeners (REPLACES: server-side events)
  startBlockchainListener();  // listens for new blocks via MetaShrew GraphQL subscription
  realtimeSubscription.on("newBlock", block => {
    globalGameState.blockHeight = block.height;
    // Update energy regen, cooldowns based on block height (no server needed)
  });
}
```

```tsx
// Real-time updates subscription pseudocode (using GraphQL subscriptions)
function startBlockListener() {
  subscribeToBlocks((newBlock) => {
    console.log(`New block ${newBlock.height} received`);
    // If any UI cooldown timers or energy regen depends on block height:
    updateCooldownTimers(newBlock.height);
    // Trigger re-fetch of any stale data (or rely on cache updates via Apollo)
  });
}
```

**Notes:** The Next.js app uses a file-based structure with pages and dynamic routes (e.g., `/governors/[id]`) for each Governor's interface. The Bitcoin wallet integration could use an in-browser wallet (like an extension or HW wallet) to prompt signature requests; it stores the active address and allows signing transactions. WebGL is employed for interactive ritual animations (e.g., showing a Governor's sigil or elemental effects) synchronized with game actions. WebSockets (or GraphQL subscriptions) ensure the UI reacts to on-chain changes promptly – for example, disabling a button after an interaction until the next block if needed, or updating the energy bar as blocks pass.

## ❌ **REMOVED**: Authentication Layer ⚠️ **COMPLETE REMOVAL**

~~JWT, Database Sessions, Social Login~~ → **Wallet-Based Identity Only**

**This entire authentication system is being removed:**
- ~~Express.js auth service with JWT management~~
- ~~User database tables~~  
- ~~Social OAuth flows~~
- ~~Session management middleware~~
- ~~Password handling~~
- ~~Server-side session storage~~

**Replaced with Bitcoin Wallet Authentication:** Player identity is simply their Bitcoin address. Authentication happens by connecting a wallet and optionally signing a message to prove ownership. No server-side user accounts, sessions, or JWTs needed.

```ts
// ❌ **REMOVED**: All backend auth service code
// NO MORE Express.js auth routes, JWT handling, OAuth flows
// NO MORE user database, session management, password handling

// **NEW**: Wallet-based authentication (client-side only)
class WalletAuthManager {
  private connectedWallet: BitcoinWallet | null = null;
  private playerAddress: string | null = null;

  async connectWallet(): Promise<string> {
    // Prompt user to select wallet (UniSat, Hiro, Xverse, etc.)
    const wallet = await detectAvailableWallets();
    const address = await wallet.connect();
    
    this.connectedWallet = wallet;
    this.playerAddress = address;
    
    // NO server call needed - address IS the identity
    return address;
  }

  async proveOwnership(message: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Optional: Sign a message to prove wallet ownership
    if (!this.connectedWallet) return false;
    
    const signature = await this.connectedWallet.signMessage(message);
    // Verify signature locally (no server needed)
    return verifySignatureLocally(this.playerAddress, message, signature);
  }

  // NO JWT tokens, NO server sessions, NO refresh logic
  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    return !!this.playerAddress;  // Just check if wallet is connected
  }
}
```

```tsx
// **Front-end Integration** (React pseudocode for login modal & context)
function LoginModal() {
  // Provide options: Connect Wallet or Social Login
  return (
    <div className="login-modal">
      <WalletAuthButton onAuth={handleWalletAuth} /> 
      <SocialAuthButton provider="Discord" href="/auth/discord" /> 
      {/* SocialAuthButton might redirect to backend OAuth URL */}
    </div>
  );
}

// ❌ **COMPLETELY REMOVED**: Legacy authentication code
// ❌ **DEPRECATED**: JWT tokens, server challenges, auth context
// ⚠️ **BITCOIN-NATIVE REPLACEMENT**: Direct wallet ownership verification

async function connectWallet() {
  // No server challenges or JWT tokens needed
  // Wallet connection proves identity through signature
  const address = await wallet.connect();
  const signature = await wallet.signMessage(`Connect to Enochian Governors: ${Date.now()}`);
  
  // Store wallet info locally (no server authentication required)
  localStorage.setItem('walletAddress', address);
  localStorage.setItem('walletConnected', 'true');
  
  // Update local state - no auth context needed
  setWalletState({ address, connected: true });
  
  // Player state comes from on-chain data via MetaShrew
  const playerState = await metashrew.query(`
    query GetPlayer($address: String!) {
      player(address: $address) {
        energy
        reputation
        lastInteraction
        artifacts
      }
    }
  `, { address });
  
  setPlayerState(playerState);
}
```

**Notes:** Bitcoin-native authentication eliminates traditional server-side authentication completely. Players prove identity through wallet signatures - no JWT tokens, no server sessions, no social login recovery mechanisms needed. All identity verification happens through cryptographic signatures from the Bitcoin wallet. Player state is retrieved directly from on-chain data via MetaShrew GraphQL queries, eliminating the need for traditional authentication flows. Account "recovery" is simply connecting a new wallet - all game progress is tied to wallet addresses that own inscribed artifacts and have transaction history on-chain. No server-side user database or session management required.

## 3. Governor Interaction UI (Dialog Tree, Transaction Builder, Cooldown Logic)

This UI lets players commune with Enochian Governors through interactive dialog trees, constructing on-chain actions from user choices. Each Governor has a dynamic dialog state machine – the current state depends on the player's reputation tier and past choices. The interface presents the Governor's message and a set of response options (questions, ritual actions, etc.), often culminating in an on-chain transaction that records the player's decision. A **Transaction Builder** component assists in crafting the appropriate Bitcoin transaction for the chosen action (e.g., invoking the Alkanes contract method with parameters). The UI also enforces **cooldown logic**: each Governor can only be interacted with once per 144 blocks (\~24h), so if the last interaction was recent, the dialog option is disabled or a timer shown. The system integrates the player's state (energy, available tokens, reputation) to validate actions and displays any costs (like energy or token burn) before confirmation.

```tsx
// React pseudocode for Governor dialog modal and interaction handling
function GovernorDialogue({ governorId }) {
  const playerState = usePlayerState();  // custom hook to get energy, rep, cooldown, etc:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
  const govProfile = useGovernor(governorId);  // Governor static profile (name, element, etc)
  const [dialogState, setDialogState] = useState(playerState.governors[governorId].state);  // current dialogue node/key
  const dialogScript = loadDialogueContent(governorId, dialogState);  // fetch from content system:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

  // Determine available choices from the script for current state
  const choices = dialogScript.options;  // each option may have: text, actionType, actionParams
  const lastBlockInteracted = playerState.governors[governorId].lastInteractBlock;
  const onCooldown = (currentBlock - lastBlockInteracted) < 144;  // 144-block (~24h) cooldown:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

  return (
    <Modal title={govProfile.name} /* Governor name/title */>
      <p className="governor-dialogue-text">{dialogScript.text}</p>
      <div className="dialogue-options">
        {choices.map(choice => (
          <button key={choice.id} disabled={onCooldown || !canAfford(choice)} onClick={() => chooseOption(choice)}>
            {choice.text}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
      {onCooldown && <p className="cooldown-msg">This Governor will respond after a ritual rest period.</p>}
    </Modal>
  );

  // helper to check if player can afford this choice (in energy/tokens)
  function canAfford(choice) {
    if (choice.cost) {
      if (choice.cost.energy && playerState.energy < choice.cost.energy) return false;
      if (choice.cost.tokens && playerState.tokens < choice.cost.tokens) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

  async function chooseOption(choice) {
    // Before sending on-chain, update local state optimistically or show loading
    if (choice.cost) spendResources(choice.cost);
    // Build the on-chain transaction for this interaction
    const tx = await buildInteractionTx(governorId, choice.actionType, choice.params);
    const result = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx);  // broadcast via wallet
    if (result.success) {
      // Update UI: advance to next dialogue state or outcome
      const newState = choice.nextState; 
      setDialogState(newState);
      // Invalidate or refresh player state from indexer to get updated rep, energy, etc.
      playerState.refresh();
    } else {
      alert("Transaction failed: " + result.error);
      rollbackSpend(choice.cost);  // if failed, refund the optimistic spend
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// Transaction builder pseudocode for various interaction types
async function buildInteractionTx(governorId, actionType, params) {
  /*
    Use the Alkanes protocol format to craft a transaction calling the game contract.
    The contract might be identified by a specific script or outpoint that the indexer watches.
    For example, an interact_governor call might require:
      - An input from the player's UTXO to pay fees and potentially carry data.
      - An output committing the action (could be an OP_RETURN or a specific Taproot script input).
      - If tokens are offered or artifact being used, include those as inputs.
  */
  const tx = new BitcoinTransaction();
  tx.addInput(await wallet.createInput());  // funding input from player's wallet for fee
  switch(actionType) {
    case 'INTERACT':  // basic dialogue interaction
      // Encode an ordinal inscription or OP_RETURN with governorId and chosen option
      tx.addOutput( createContractCallOutput('interact_governor', { govId: governorId, choice: params.choiceId }) );
      break;
    case 'OFFERING':  // offering tokens to Governor
      // Attach token UTXO and instruct contract to burn it:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
      const tokenUtxo = await wallet.getTokenUtxo(params.amount);
      tx.addInput(tokenUtxo);
      tx.addOutput( createContractCallOutput('offer_to_governor', { govId: governorId, amount: params.amount }) );
      break;
    case 'SOLVE_PUZZLE':  // answer a riddle/cipher
      // Hash the answer and include it in the call for on-chain verification:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
      const answerHash = sha256(params.answer);
      tx.addOutput( createContractCallOutput('solve_puzzle', { puzzleId: params.puzzleId, answerHash }) );
      break;
    case 'INVOKE_CHAOS':  // trigger a random event (gamble)
      // Provide a small token bet for randomness and reward pool
      const betUtxo = await wallet.getTokenUtxo(params.bet);
      tx.addInput(betUtxo);
      tx.addOutput( createContractCallOutput('invoke_chaos', { govId: governorId, bet: params.bet }) );
      break;
    // ... other action types like crafting artifacts, etc.
  }
  // Sign the transaction inputs with user's keys
  await wallet.signTransaction(tx);
  return tx;
}
```

**Notes:** The dialog UI relies on content from the **Content Management** system (section 8) to populate `dialogScript.text` and options for the current state. The `GovernorDialogue` component coordinates between the UI and the blockchain: it ensures the player has enough **energy and tokens** for the selected action (e.g., an option might require burning 5 tokens as an offering or using 1 energy), and then calls `buildInteractionTx` to construct the transaction. The `buildInteractionTx` pseudocode illustrates different possible on-chain actions:

* **INTERACT**: a basic dialog advancement that calls the contract's `interact_governor` handler (likely logging the choice and updating on-chain state) with the governor ID and choice made.
* **OFFERING**: burning in-game currency (Enochian tokens) in exchange for reputation gain – the transaction includes a token UTXO input that the contract will consume (remove from circulation).
* **SOLVE\_PUZZLE**: submitting an answer to a cryptographic puzzle; the contract will verify the answer by comparing hashes.
* **INVOKE\_CHAOS**: initiating a random event or gamble; a token bet is included and the contract will use a randomness source (like block hash) to determine outcome.

The **cooldown logic** is reflected in the UI (`onCooldown` flag) and reinforced on-chain: the contract will reject interactions if 144 blocks haven't passed since the last one for that Governor. The UI proactively disables the button and can show a countdown (blocks or time remaining) until the next allowed interaction. The TransactionStatus (or feedback after sending) informs the user of success or failure (e.g., if the contract reverted due to cooldown or insufficient resources, the UI can show an error). After a successful transaction, the UI updates the state – e.g., increment reputation, decrement energy – either optimistically or by fetching the latest state from the MetaShrew indexer. The 3D WebGL canvas (via `InteractionCanvas` component) can also react to interactions (for example, playing a special effect when an offering is made or a puzzle is solved, perhaps keyed by `actionType` and Governor's element/domain for thematic visuals).

## 4. Artifact NFT System (Ordinal Metadata, Benefits, Transfer)

**Artifacts** in Enochian are unique NFT items (often inscribed as Bitcoin Ordinals) that players can earn, trade, and utilize. Each artifact carries metadata and potential in-game benefits or drawbacks (e.g., increased energy cap, or a curse affecting reputation gains). The system relies on the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol to store artifact data on-chain as immutable inscriptions. Each artifact is represented by an Ordinal (a satoshi with an attached inscription file, e.g., JSON or image), and the game's contract logic ensures artifacts are minted and assigned when players achieve certain milestones (e.g., completing a quest or reaching a reputation threshold triggers minting a specific artifact NFT). The **MetaShrew indexer** tracks artifact ownership by monitoring transfers of those inscription UTXOs, updating each player's inventory in the game state.

Key features:

* **Metadata**: An artifact's inscription may include its name, description, and effects (in human-readable form) for transparency on-chain. Off-chain, we maintain a catalog of artifact definitions (ID, name, effect stats) to drive game logic.
* **Benefits/Effects**: On possessing an artifact, certain player stats can be modified. For example, the "Ring of the Fallen Angel" increases max energy by +5 but halves reputation gains with holy Governors. The contract checks artifact ownership flags in state or via indexer queries and adjusts calculations accordingly (e.g., in energy calculation or reputation gain function).
* **Transfer**: Artifacts being Ordinal NFTs means ownership transfers by standard Bitcoin transactions. Players can trade artifacts by simply sending the inscription to another address (through their wallet). The indexer will pick up the new owner and update game state (e.g., moving the artifact from one inventory to another). In-game, we provide an **Inventory UI** to list a player's artifacts and possibly a transfer interface to initiate sends.

```rust
// **Smart Contract Pseudocode** – Artifact management (Rust-like pseudocode within the Alkanes contract)
struct ArtifactDefinition {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    effects: ArtifactEffects,  // e.g., { energyBonus: i32, repMultiplier: f32, curseTag: Option<String> }
    ordinalInscriptionRef: String  // reference to the inscription content (could be IPFS link or content hash)
}

// Game state snippet: track which artifacts a player owns (could be explicit or inferred via indexer)
struct PlayerState {
    address: Address,
    artifacts: Vec<u32>,  // list of artifact IDs in player's possession (for quick lookup of effects)
    // ... other fields like energy, reputation map, etc.
}

// Minting a new artifact to a player when conditions met (e.g., quest completed)
fn grantArtifact(player: &mut PlayerState, artifact_id: u32) {
    // Ensure artifact not already owned and conditions are satisfied
    assert!(!player.artifacts.contains(&artifact_id));
    player.artifacts.push(artifact_id);
    log_event("ArtifactMinted", player.address, artifact_id);  // emit event for indexer
    
    // The actual Ordinal minting process:
    // Compose the artifact's metadata (e.g., a JSON with name/description) and inscribe on Bitcoin.
    // For simplicity, assume an external process listens for ArtifactMinted events to perform inscription.
    // Alternatively, the contract could include the inscription in the transaction output if Alkanes supports it.
}

// Example: using artifact effects in contract logic
fn calculateMaxEnergy(player: &PlayerState) -> u32 {
    let mut max_energy = BASE_MAX_ENERGY;  // e.g., 25 by default
    if player.artifacts.contains(&RING_OF_FALLEN_ANGEL_ID) {
        max_energy += 5;  // energy buff from Ring:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}
    }
    // other artifact effects could also modify energy or other stats
    max_energy
}

fn applyReputationGain(player: &mut PlayerState, governor: GovernorId, base_gain: u8) {
    let mut gain = base_gain;
    // If player has the Ring of Fallen Angel and this Governor is holy-aligned, halve the rep gain:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}
    if player.artifacts.contains(&RING_OF_FALLEN_ANGEL_ID) && governor.is_holy() {
        gain = (gain as f32 * 0.5) as u8;
    }
    player.reputation[governor] += gain;
}
```

```tsx
// **Front-End Inventory UI** (React pseudocode for displaying and transferring artifacts)
function Inventory() {
  const { artifacts } = useInventory();  // custom hook loading player's artifact list and details:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}
  return (
    <div className="inventory">
      <h2>Your Arcane Artifacts</h2>
      <div className="artifact-grid">
        {artifacts.map(artifact => (
          <ArtifactCard key={artifact.id} artifact={artifact} onTransfer={handleTransfer} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  async function handleTransfer(artifact) {
    const recipientAddress = prompt("Enter recipient's Bitcoin address to transfer " + artifact.name);
    if (!recipientAddress) return;
    // Use wallet to create and send a Bitcoin TX transferring the ordinal
    const artifactUtxo = await wallet.getOrdinalUtxo(artifact.id);
    const tx = new BitcoinTransaction();
    tx.addInput(artifactUtxo);
    tx.addOutput({ address: recipientAddress, value: 546 });  // send the sat (with inscription) to recipient (546 sats min for inscription)
    await wallet.signTransaction(tx);
    const result = await wallet.broadcast(tx);
    if (result.success) {
      alert(`Transferred ${artifact.name} to ${recipientAddress}`);
    } else {
      alert("Transfer failed: " + result.error);
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:** The **contract pseudocode** shows how artifacts might be represented and how their effects integrate into game logic. In practice, minting an Ordinal inscription on-chain with the artifact's data might require cooperation between the contract and an external inscription process (since Bitcoin contracts can't on their own create new inscriptions without pre-committed data). One approach is that the contract emits an event (as shown with `log_event("ArtifactMinted", ...)`) which the MetaShrew indexer or a separate service listens for, and then automatically creates the inscription (embedding the artifact metadata and linking it to the event) and assigns it to the player's address. Alternatively, artifact NFTs might be pre-inscribed and the contract "assigns" one by transferring ownership, but given the text, the design suggests artifacts are minted at the moment of discovery for permanence.

The **inventory UI** allows players to view artifacts (each represented by an `ArtifactCard` with image and stats) and initiate transfers. Since these NFTs are true Bitcoin Ordinals, transferring is done by constructing a Bitcoin transaction sending the specific satoshi (containing the artifact inscription) to the target address. The wallet integration helps identify the UTXO of the artifact (which the indexer can label, e.g., by artifact ID or inscription ID) and build the transfer transaction. The game does not require a separate smart contract call for transfers – it's a standard Bitcoin send – but the indexer will detect this and update the internal state (removing the artifact from the sender's inventory and adding to the recipient's). In-game effects of artifacts are always tied to ownership as reflected on-chain; for example, if you trade away the Ring of the Fallen Angel, the next time the indexer processes that transfer, your `playerState` will drop the ring's ID and thus your max energy bonus and rep penalty are removed.

Finally, each artifact typically has **lore** associated with it (which can be stored off-chain in content files and possibly inscribed as well). The Ordinal inscription itself might contain a short lore snippet or at least a reference (hash or ID) that ties to fuller lore in the content system. This way, the **Bitcoin blockchain acts as a source of truth** for artifact creation and ownership, while the game logic and content system together enforce their utility and narrative significance.

## 5. Game Mechanics (Energy, Reputation, Token Economy)

The core game mechanics revolve around resource management and progression: **Energy** limits how often a player can act, **Reputation** measures a player's standing with each Governor, and the **Token economy** introduces a fungible currency (Enochian tokens) for sacrifices and other actions. All these mechanics are managed on-chain via the Alkanes contract, ensuring fairness and transparency in the occult progression.

* **Energy:** Each player has an energy pool that is consumed for actions (e.g., initiating a dialogue or performing a ritual might cost 1 energy). A base max energy (say 25) can be increased by certain artifacts or global bonuses. Energy regenerates over time – implemented in block terms. For example, the contract could regenerate 1 energy every N blocks or fully refill energy at specific intervals. A simple scheme: 1 energy per 6 blocks (\~1 hour) up to max. The contract tracks the last block an energy was spent or last full refill, and on each action or on a periodic `energy_management` handler, it recalculates the current energy based on blocks elapsed. This is deterministic via blockchain time and doesn't require an off-chain cron. Energy ensures players cannot grind infinitely in a short time; they must either wait for recharge or possibly obtain items that grant extra energy. The UI shows an **EnergyMeter** component reflecting current energy and max, updating in real-time (with block subscriptions driving increments).

* **Reputation:** Reputation is a per-Governor score (0 to 100) representing trust/rapport. Players gain rep by successful interactions, offerings, quests, etc. On-chain, `player.reputation[govId]` is stored, and increases are applied in the contract when appropriate. There are **tiers** of reputation unlocking content: e.g., below 50 the Governor may be aloof, 50–74 they offer trials, 75+ unlocks secrets. The contract enforces these gates by only allowing certain actions or dialogue branches if rep is high enough. Additionally, reaching rep milestones can trigger **boons** – e.g., at rep 50 or 100, the contract might automatically grant an artifact or special ability. We ensure rep never exceeds the cap (100). The reputation gain function will incorporate modifiers: for instance, if the player has a cursed item affecting rep (like the ring), apply a multiplier penalty for certain Governors. Also, to prevent abuse, rep gains might be limited per day or tied to spending tokens (to slow grinding). Combined with the daily one-interaction-per-Governor rule and energy, the pace of reputation growth is controlled. The UI shows reputation per Governor (e.g., a **ReputationDisplay** bar in the Governor profile) and possibly a global progress towards befriending all 91.

* **Token Economy:** The game introduces an **Enochian Token** (a fungible in-game currency) used for offerings, gambling, and other mechanics. These tokens are implemented on-chain (they could be a separate token contract or handled within the game contract as a resource). For simplicity, we treat them as a tracked balance in the player's state and as UTXOs on Bitcoin that can be burned or transferred. Players might earn tokens through quests, find them in treasure, or even purchase them out-of-game; tokens can then be **offered** to Governors for extra rep or consumed to attempt random rituals. The contract ensures token consumption is atomic with the action (the token UTXO must be included and is destroyed in the transaction). This creates a sink: tokens are burned for advantages (rep boosts, second chances at puzzles, etc.). The total token supply and distribution can be managed off-chain (initial mint or sale) but every in-game use is on-chain. The UI shows the player's token balance (e.g., **TokenBalance** component) and deducts it when they perform actions costing tokens.

Below is pseudocode summarizing these mechanics within the contract and how they tie together:

```rust
// **Smart Contract Pseudocode** – Energy, Reputation, and Token logic
const BASE_MAX_ENERGY: u8 = 25;
const ENERGY_REGEN_INTERVAL: u32 = 6;  // regen 1 energy per 6 blocks (~1 hour)
const MAX_REPUTATION: u8 = 100;

struct PlayerState {
    energy: u8,
    lastEnergyUpdate: u32,      // block height when energy was last recalculated
    reputation: HashMap<GovernorId, u8>,
    tokens: u64,                // balance of Enochian tokens (could represent as satoshis or separate unit)
    lastInteract: HashMap<GovernorId, u32>,  // block of last interaction per Governor
    // ... (artifacts, etc.)
}

fn onPlayerAction(player: &mut PlayerState, current_block: u32, action_cost_energy: u8, cost_tokens: u64, gov_id: Option<GovernorId>) -> Result<()> {
    // ⚠️ **SECURITY FIX**: Regenerate energy with overflow protection
    let blocks_elapsed = current_block - player.lastEnergyUpdate;

**Notes:** In this pseudocode:

* `onPlayerAction` centralizes checks for energy, tokens, and cooldown. It uses `ensure!` (a check macro) to abort if conditions aren't met. It also demonstrates regenerating energy based on blocks passed since `lastEnergyUpdate` – ensuring energy ticks up automatically with the blockchain's progression. This function would be called at the start of any contract handler (like `interact_governor`, `solve_puzzle`, etc.) with the appropriate costs (e.g., interact costs 1 energy, solve puzzle maybe 0 energy but might have a token cost, etc.). This way, every action enforces resource constraints consistently.
* `increaseReputation` modifies reputation and triggers rewards at certain thresholds (50, 75, 100). This aligns with game design where new content or artifacts unlock at higher rep. For example, `grantArtifact(player, gov.boonArtifactId)` mints the Governor's special artifact when rep ≥75, and `unlockMidTierContent` might mark that the Governor's dialogue should include more advanced topics now that the player is trusted.
* `offerTokens` models the offering mechanic: it assumes the token deduction is handled by `onPlayerAction` (so `player.tokens` has already been reduced and the UTXO was burned). It then calculates a rep gain from the amount (with diminishing returns or caps to avoid pay-to-win, e.g., max +5 rep per offering transaction).
* `gamble` showcases a randomness-based token mechanic (a simplified "chaos gamble"). It uses the block hash mod 1000 as a random number source (which is publicly verifiable). Depending on the roll, the player might win additional tokens (with some multiplier on their bet) or lose their bet. The odds and payouts can be tuned (the example gives \~1% for a big win, 9% for small win, 90% lose). Losses mean the bet tokens were burned (as they were deducted going in), creating a house edge that serves as a token sink and ensures players can't create tokens from nothing on average. The contract logs events for wins/losses which could be used to notify the player through the indexer.

These mechanics together ensure a balanced progression:

* **Energy** gates the rate of actions (no infinite spamming; even if a player has many tokens, energy regen and daily NPC cooldowns require pacing).
* **Reputation** provides long-term goals for each NPC, with meaningful checkpoints and rewards for reaching them, all recorded on-chain (no one can fake a reputation they didn't earn).
* **Tokens** introduce economic decisions – spend tokens to accelerate progress (offerings) or gamble for rewards, versus saving them. Because tokens must be earned or purchased, they serve as a monetization and anti-grind control (players can't endlessly interact without tokens for certain actions, and if they buy tokens, those tokens get burned for advantages, controlling inflation).

The **UI** reflects these systems: Energy and token counts are displayed and updated live; actions buttons are enabled/disabled based on current energy/tokens; reputation bars fill as you progress with each Governor. Tooltips can explain the effects (e.g., "Offering 5 tokens will give +1 reputation" or "Out of energy – wait for recharge or use an item"). Overall, the on-chain enforcement (via Alkanes) and real-time feedback (via MetaShrew queries) combine to make the game mechanics transparent and robust.

## 6. Alkanes Contract Templates (player.rs, artifact.rs, interaction.rs)

The game's smart contract, built on the **Alkanes** protocol, is organized into modules that encapsulate different domain logic. We have a Rust-based contract (WASM compiled) divided into, for example, `player.rs`, `governor.rs`, `artifact.rs`, and handlers for interactions. These act as **templates** for the on-chain logic, delineating state and behavior:

* **player.rs** – Manages player state (energy, tokens, inventory, reputation map) and provides functions to initialize new players and update their stats.
* **artifact.rs** – Handles artifact definitions and creation. Functions to mint artifacts (as Ordinals) and apply artifact effects belong here.
* **interaction.rs** – Contains the core game logic for processing an interaction transaction. This includes validating an action, updating state (calling functions from player/artifact modules), and emitting relevant events. In the actual repo structure, this might correspond to multiple handlers (e.g., `interact_governor.rs`, `craft_artifact.rs`, etc.), but for our pseudocode, we summarize it as one module controlling turn-based interactions.

Below, we outline these components in pseudocode form, illustrating how they interconnect:

```rust
// player.rs – Defines player state and basic operations
mod player {
    use super::*;  // assume it imports types from a common module
    
    pub struct Player {  // on-chain player state

**Explanation:** This contract template is structured to be clear and maintainable:

* The **player module** encapsulates player-related data and basic operations (initialization, resource spending, reputation adjusting). It's essentially the on-chain representation of a player.
* The **artifact module** manages artifact definitions and how to grant them. It also provides functions to incorporate artifact effects into game calculations (to keep those checks logically grouped).
* The **interaction logic** is where a transaction's intent is executed. It uses the other modules to do the heavy lifting (e.g., adjust energy, spend tokens, apply artifact modifiers, update rep). Each branch of the `match` handles a different action type:

  * *DialogueChoice*: the simplest form, maybe just a state transition and a small rep reward for engaging.
  * *OfferTokens*: takes an amount of tokens (assumed already deducted) and converts to rep, logging an event.
  * *SolvePuzzle*: verifies a puzzle answer via a stored hash and rewards rep and possibly an artifact (puzzle reward).
  * *InvokeChaos*: a random event generator (with pseudorandomness derived from block hash) that can bless or curse the player at low probabilities.
  * *CraftArtifact*: an example where multiple items (not fully shown) could be combined to create a new artifact NFT – this would consume components (ensuring the player had them) and call `mint_artifact`.

Throughout, events are logged for important occurrences (progress, offerings, solutions, random outcomes, artifact mints). These events allow the **MetaShrew indexer** to update the off-chain state and trigger front-end notifications. The separation into modules mirrors an organized codebase (as seen in the architecture, e.g., `state/player.rs`, `state/artifacts.rs`, `handlers/interact_governor.rs`, etc. correspond to these responsibilities). By following this template, developers or an AI code generator can implement the detailed logic in each function with confidence that the structure covers all needed aspects: initializing and tracking player progression, enforcing game rules each interaction, and expanding the game by adding new `Action` variants or artifact types as needed without breaking the overall design.

## 7. MetaShrew Indexer Integration (GraphQL schema, Subscriptions)

The **MetaShrew indexer** is a critical back-end service that monitors the Bitcoin blockchain (specifically our game's transactions and inscriptions) and provides a **GraphQL API** for querying game state and subscribing to events. It continuously ingests new blocks and updates a mirrored state (likely stored in a Postgres database) of players, governors, artifacts, etc., by running the Alkanes contract logic on each relevant transaction (much like how an Ethereum indexer applies transactions to contract state). The indexer enables the front-end to get a real-time, high-level view of the game world without each client needing to parse raw blockchain data or run the contract logic themselves.

**GraphQL Schema:** We define types for all game entities and queries/mutations/subscriptions to retrieve them:

```graphql
# GraphQL Schema (SDL pseudocode)
type Query {
  player(address: ID!): Player
  players(offset: Int, limit: Int): [Player!]!
  governor(id: Int!): Governor
  governors: [Governor!]!
  artifact(id: Int!): Artifact
  artifacts(owner: ID): [Artifact!]!  # can filter artifacts by owner address
}

type Mutation {
  # Possibly if we had off-chain actions, but most game actions are on-chain, so Mutations might be minimal or not used.
  # Could include something like "registerPlayer" if needed to initialize state off-chain.
}

type Subscription {
  newBlock: Block!        # emits every new block
  playerUpdated(address: ID!): Player!   # emits whenever a player's state changes (energy, rep, etc.)
  artifactTransferred(id: Int!): Artifact!  # emits on artifact ownership change
  # ... other subscriptions like newGovernorInteraction etc.
}

type Player {
  address: ID!
  energy: Int!
  maxEnergy: Int!
  tokens: Int!
  reputation: [ReputationEntry!]!  # could be a type with governorId and value
  artifacts: [Artifact!]!         # list of artifacts currently owned
}

type Governor {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  domain: String!       # e.g., "Alchemy", "Time", etc.
  playerReputation(address: ID!): Int  # convenience to get a specific player's rep with this Governor
  totalInteractions: Int!  # how many interactions happened globally (for leaderboard maybe)
}

type Artifact {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  owner: ID!          # address of current owner
  metadataURI: String # link to the Ordinal inscription or metadata
}

type Block {
  height: Int!
  hash: String!
  timestamp: Int!
}
```

**Resolvers & Subscriptions:** The indexer's server (could be implemented in Rust or Node) will have resolver functions to supply the data for these schema fields. For instance, `Query.player(address)` will fetch the player row from the database (joining in related data like artifacts). `player.reputation` might be a computed list derived from a join table of player-governor reputations. Subscriptions are fed by the indexer's event triggers:

* When a new block is processed, broadcast `newBlock` to subscribers (with block height/hash).
* When a transaction alters a player's state, emit `playerUpdated(address)` with the updated Player object.
* When an artifact transfer is seen, emit `artifactTransferred(id)` with the new artifact state.

Using Apollo or similar, these can be implemented by hooking into the indexer's event bus.

```rs
// **Indexer pseudocode (Rust)** – Processing loop and event publishing
fn process_block(block: Block) {
    for tx in block.transactions {
        if let Some(game_action) = parseGameAction(tx) {
            // Use Alkanes contract logic to update state
            let events = apply_game_transaction(game_action);
            // Persist updated state to database (players, reps, etc.)
            db::applyStateChanges(events.state_deltas);
            // Publish events to GraphQL subscriptions:
            for e in events.emitted {
                match e {
                    Event::PlayerStateChanged(addr) => {
                        let player = db::getPlayer(addr);
                        publish_subscription("playerUpdated", addr, player);
                    }
                    Event::ArtifactTransferred(artId, newOwner) => {
                        let artifact = db::getArtifact(artId);
                        publish_subscription("artifactTransferred", artId, artifact);
                    }
                    // ... handle other event types ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    publish_subscription("newBlock", None, block.to_summary());
}
```

```ts
// **Front-End Usage (Apollo client example)** – Querying and subscribing
import { gql, useQuery, useSubscription } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_PLAYER = gql`
  query GetPlayer($address: ID!) {
    player(address: $address) {
      address
      energy
      maxEnergy
      tokens
      reputation { governorId value }
      artifacts { id name description }
    }
  }
`;
const PLAYER_UPDATED = gql`
  subscription OnPlayerUpdated($address: ID!) {
    playerUpdated(address: $address) {
      energy
      tokens
      reputation { governorId value }
      artifacts { id owner }
    }
  }
`;

function usePlayerState(address) {
  // Hook to get player data and listen for updates
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_PLAYER, { variables: { address } });
  useSubscription(PLAYER_UPDATED, { variables: { address },
    onSubscriptionData: ({ subscriptionData }) => {
      // Merge subscription updates into cached player data
      client.cache.writeQuery({
        query: GET_PLAYER,
        data: { player: subscriptionData.data.playerUpdated }
      });
    }
  });
  return {
    player: data?.player,
    loading, error
  };
}

// Similarly, could have subscriptions for new blocks or artifact transfers if needed for UI.
```

**Notes:** The GraphQL schema and integration provide a **high-level API** for the front-end (or any external tools) to retrieve game state. For example, the front-end can query `player(address)` to get all relevant info about the player in one request, rather than calling separate endpoints for energy, inventory, etc. The schema design avoids exposing raw internal details (like lastInteract or puzzle hashes) and instead focuses on what the client needs (current resource counts, lists of artifacts, etc.). If something isn't directly exposed (say, last interaction block for each Governor), the client can either derive it (cooldown = true if rep > 0 and no new interaction event yet in current day, or a custom field could be added to schema if necessary).

The indexer uses **GraphQL subscriptions** to push real-time updates. Under the hood, Apollo might use WebSockets for this. When `publish_subscription("playerUpdated", ...)` is called on the server, any client subscribed to `playerUpdated` with that address will receive the new Player data. This is how the UI stays in sync without polling. For instance, after a user sends a transaction, within a few seconds the indexer will see it included in a block, update the state (e.g., energy reduced, rep increased), and push the updated player object. The React hook `useSubscription` then merges that into the Apollo cache, automatically re-rendering components showing those values (like EnergyMeter or ReputationDisplay).

The **MetaShrew indexer** likely also provides filtering and complex queries (maybe not needed in game, but possible - e.g., leaderboards: `players(orderBy: totalReputation, limit:10)`). It serves as the game's memory, since the Bitcoin chain itself doesn't offer easy querying. By structuring the indexer as above (with resolvers like `player.rs`, `governors.rs`, etc. in code), the separation of concerns is clear: the on-chain contract enforces rules and produces events, and the off-chain indexer organizes data for consumption.

Security-wise, the indexer must verify all on-chain data (never trust client input) – that's inherent since it derives state from the blockchain directly. The GraphQL layer might implement rate-limiting or auth if needed (for example, to restrict certain queries or to avoid spam on subscriptions). But generally, game state is public, so heavy auth isn't necessary beyond maybe preventing abuse.

In summary, the MetaShrew integration provides:

* **Query APIs** for current state (used on page load or when navigating to a new Governor's page, etc.).
* **Subscriptions** for reactive updates (player stats, new global events, etc.).
* Possibly **API for content** – though content is separate, GraphQL could also serve some content if integrated, but as per design, content comes from Git (see next section).

This robust indexing and API layer ensures that despite all logic being on Bitcoin L1, the user experience is smooth and dynamic, with near-instant feedback and rich data accessibility.

## 8. Content Management (Git CMS, Dynamic lore/quests)

To manage the extensive lore and dynamic narrative (91 Governors each with dialogues, quests, etc.), we use a **Git-based Content Management System**. This means game content – such as character profiles, dialogue scripts, quest descriptions, etc. – is stored in version-controlled files (Markdown or JSON) rather than hard-coded. Writers and designers can update these files and, through an automated pipeline, have the game use the new content without needing to redeploy the application code.

**Structure:** We maintain a content directory (in a separate repo or a subfolder) organized by content type:

```
content/
├── governors/
│   ├── 1.json        # Governor 1's profile and dialogue tree
│   ├── 2.json        # Governor 2, etc...
│   └── ...
├── quests/
│   ├── quest1.md     # Quest storyline and hints
│   └── ...
├── artifacts/
│   ├── artifact1.md  # Artifact lore and description
│   └── ...
└── static/
    ├── glossary.md   # Other lore pages
    └── ...
```

For example, each Governor might have a JSON file containing structured dialogue and events. This could include an array of dialog nodes with IDs, the text the Governor says, the player's choices, and pointers to next nodes or associated game actions:

```json
// Example snippet of a Governor's dialogue JSON (simplified)
{
  "id": 47,
  "name": "ALDAPI",
  "dialogue": [
    {
      "state": 0,
      "text": "The Governor eyes you warily for the first time...",
      "options": [
        { "id": 1, "text": "Bow respectfully", "nextState": 1, "repGain": 1 },
        { "id": 2, "text": "Announce yourself boldly", "nextState": 2, "repGain": 0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "state": 1,
      "text": "He nods, acknowledging your courtesy. 'Why have you sought me?'",
      "options": [
        { "id": 3, "text": "To learn the secrets of your art.", "nextState": 3 },
        { "id": 4, "text": "I seek an artifact.", "nextState": 4 }
      ]
    }
    // ... more states ...
  ]
}
```

The front-end uses this content to drive the `GovernorDialogue` component (as seen earlier, `loadDialogueContent(governorId, state)` would fetch or reference this JSON and find the entry with `state` matching current dialogue state). By storing dialogues externally, we can tweak narrative and choices without altering the contract – as long as the choices map to the correct on-chain actions (e.g., `repGain` is advisory for UI; actual rep gain is applied by contract, but we might include it in content for clarity).

**Dynamic Quests:** Similar approach for quests – each quest's storyline, clues, and steps can be written in Markdown with embedded metadata (using frontmatter via **gray-matter** library). For instance:

```markdown
---
id: "dream_puzzle"
governor: 10
reward: { artifact: 5, rep: 10 }
---
**The Dream Puzzle**  
You receive a cryptic dream from Governor #10, filled with Enochian symbols...

*Objective:* Solve the riddle hidden in the dream's poem.

*Hint:* The first letters of each line might form a word.
```

The content service or front-end can parse this and present it appropriately in the UI (quest log, etc.). The `reward` field can be cross-referenced with game logic; e.g., when the puzzle is solved via the contract, it grants artifact 5 and 10 rep as per this content.

// Usage: No server endpoints needed
const contentLoader = new OrdinalContentLoader(CONTENT_MANIFEST_INSCRIPTION_ID);
const governorContent = await contentLoader.loadGovernorContent('OCCODON');
```

**Bitcoin-Native Content System:** Content is permanently inscribed on Bitcoin and loaded on-demand through the `OrdinalContentLoader`. Unlike traditional systems requiring continuous deployment and server maintenance, Bitcoin inscription creates immortal content that cannot be lost or corrupted.

**Content Updates via Reinscription:** When content needs updating (new dialogue, quest fixes, etc.), we reinscribe the updated content:

* **New Content**: Create new inscription with updated content and add inscription ID to manifest
* **Manifest Updates**: Update the content manifest inscription with new pointers
* **Atomic Updates**: All content changes are atomic - either fully inscribed or not present
* **Version History**: Previous inscriptions remain permanently on Bitcoin, providing complete audit trail

**Content Validation Pipeline:** Before inscription, content validation ensures quality:

```bash
# Content validation before inscription
node scripts/validate-content.js --check-all
node scripts/validate-governor-profiles.js --complete
node scripts/validate-quest-logic.js --test-flows
```

**Localization Support:** Multiple language inscriptions can be created with language-specific manifest entries:

```json
{
  "governors": {
    "OCCODON": {
      "en": "inscription_id_english",
      "es": "inscription_id_spanish", 
      "zh": "inscription_id_chinese"
    }
  }
}
```

**Bitcoin-Native Content Management Benefits:**

* **Permanent Storage**: Content exists forever on Bitcoin blockchain
* **Zero Hosting Costs**: No servers, CDNs, or databases to maintain
* **Global Distribution**: Available wherever Bitcoin is accessible
* **Immutable History**: Complete version control built into Bitcoin
* **Censorship Resistant**: Cannot be taken down or modified by third parties

This inscription-based approach eliminates traditional content deployment complexity while providing superior reliability and permanence.

## 🚨 **AUDIT SECTION 6 FIX**: Automated Manifest Management & Rollback System

The audit identified critical gaps in manifest automation and rollback capabilities. Manual manifest updates are error-prone and lack versioning/rollback strategies. Here's the automated solution:

```typescript
// Automated Manifest Management System

  private readonly MANIFEST_INSCRIPTION_PREFIX = 'enochian_manifest_v';
  private currentManifestVersion: number = 0;
  private rollbackHistory: ManifestVersion[] = [];

      // 3. Inscribe new manifest with version control
      const newManifestId = await this.inscribeVersionedManifest(newManifest);
      
      // 4. Atomic rollback capability - store previous version
      this.storeRollbackPoint(this.currentManifestVersion, newManifestId);
      
      // 5. Update client references
      await this.updateClientManifestReferences(newManifestId);

## 9. Telemetry + Analytics (Event Tracker, Dashboard Hooks)

To refine the game and ensure smooth operation, we implement a telemetry and analytics pipeline that captures gameplay events and user behavior. This involves instrumenting both the front-end and back-end to emit events to an analytics system, which can then be analyzed in dashboards for insights. The goal is to track things like: how often players interact with each Governor, token spending patterns, success/failure rates of puzzles, performance metrics, and any errors or unusual behavior.

**Front-end Event Tracking:** In the front-end, we include an **EventTracker** utility (or context) that logs key user actions and game events:

* When a player initiates an interaction (clicks a dialog option), we log an event "InteractionStarted" with which Governor.
* When the result of a transaction comes back (success or failure), log "InteractionResult" with outcome and any error details.
* Other events: "PuzzleSolvedAttempt", "ArtifactEquipped", "PageView(Profile)" etc., as needed for understanding usage.
* Additionally, collect performance metrics like page load time, frame rate in WebGL scenes, and any JS errors (with anonymized stack) to catch front-end issues.

These events can be sent to an analytics server or third-party services (we have libraries for **PostHog** and **Mixpanel** integrated). We also consider privacy – no sensitive personal data, mostly in-game events.

```tsx
// Front-end pseudo-code: using a custom analytics hook to track events
import analytics from '@/lib/analytics/tracking';  // abstraction over Mixpanel/PostHog

function useGameAnalytics() {
  const track = analytics.trackEvent;  // e.g., wraps mixpanel.track or sends to backend
  
  // Example: track an interaction lifecycle
  const recordInteraction = (govId, choiceId) => {
    track('InteractionStarted', { governor: govId, choice: choiceId });
  };
  const recordInteractionResult = (govId, choiceId, success, errorMsg) => {
    track('InteractionResult', { governor: govId, choice: choiceId, success, error: errorMsg });
  };
  
  // Example: track a puzzle attempt
  const recordPuzzleAttempt = (puzzleId, solved) => {
    track('PuzzleAttempt', { puzzle: puzzleId, solved });
  };

  // Example: track performance (like page load)
  useEffect(() => {
    const perf = window.performance;
    track('PageLoaded', { 
      page: window.location.pathname, 
      loadTime: perf.timing.domContentLoadedEventEnd - perf.timing.navigationStart 
    });
  }, []);
  
  return { recordInteraction, recordInteractionResult, recordPuzzleAttempt };
}

// Usage in components:
const { recordInteraction, recordInteractionResult } = useGameAnalytics();
function onDialogueOptionSelected(govId, choiceId) {
  recordInteraction(govId, choiceId);
  sendTransaction(choiceId).then(res => {
    recordInteractionResult(govId, choiceId, res.success, res.error);
  });
}
```

**Back-end Event Collection:** On the server side, some events are better captured by the indexer or API:

* When a block is processed, how many game transactions were in it? Could log "TransactionsPerBlock" for monitoring throughput.
* If an error occurs in contract execution (shouldn't happen if well-validated, but maybe track unexpected reverts or indexer parsing issues).
* Aggregated stats: the indexer could emit an event "DailyActivePlayers" or similar once a day.
* The separate **analytics service** (foundation described creating `backend/analytics` with Kafka, Redis, etc.) can ingest events from both front-end and back-end. We might use Kafka as a buffer: front-end events are sent to an API endpoint that pushes them to a Kafka topic, and the analytics service consumes them to store in a database for analytics or forward to external analytics.

For simplicity, assume we send events to an API:

```ts
// Pseudocode for a simple analytics collector endpoint (could be part of backend/api or a separate service)
app.post('/analytics/event', (req, res) => {
  const { event, properties } = req.body;
  // Basic validation...
  analyticsQueue.push({ event, properties, timestamp: Date.now() });
  res.sendStatus(204);
});

// In analytics service, consuming events
analyticsQueue.on('event', evt => {
  // Log to console or file for now
  console.log(`[Analytics] ${evt.event}`, evt.properties);
  // Optionally, forward to external service
  posthog.capture(evt.event, evt.properties);
  mixpanel.track(evt.event, evt.properties);
  // Or store in a database for custom queries
  db.insert('events', evt);
});
```

**Analytics Dashboard:** We set up dashboards to visualize this data. For business metrics and live monitoring:

* Use **Grafana** for internal metrics (the infrastructure includes Grafana dashboards for system metrics and game analytics). We can push certain metrics via Prometheus (e.g., number of interactions per hour, number of active players, etc.) and have Grafana charts.
* For user behavior, PostHog/Mixpanel provide their own dashboards where product managers can analyze funnels, retention, etc.
* We may also have a custom admin dashboard in the app (maybe under an admin route) that uses the GraphQL API or direct DB queries to show game stats (like how many players have reached certain rep, or a leaderboard of token holders). The architecture hints at an analytics components (ABTest, MetricsCollector) and possibly hooking into something like an internal dashboard.

**A/B Testing:** We included an `ABTest.tsx` component. We can use this to experiment with different UI or content:

* For example, test two versions of a tutorial to see which yields better retention. The ABTest component could randomly assign a variant to a user (or do so based on an experiment config fetched from analytics service) and then we track events with variant info to see outcomes.
* The telemetry will record which variant user saw and their performance.

**Telemetry vs Analytics:** Telemetry also covers logging and error tracking:

* We integrate with monitoring tools: perhaps send critical errors to Sentry or log to a backend.
* The roadmap mentions performance and compliance metrics in CI, but at runtime, telemetry ensures we catch issues early. E.g., if a particular Governor's interaction fails often, our events "InteractionResult(success=false, error=X)" will show a spike, alerting us to a bug or imbalance.

All analytics are gathered respecting privacy and stored securely (the data is mostly game-oriented, but still, we avoid any PII aside from maybe an anonymized user ID or address, which is public anyway in blockchain context).

By scaffolding an analytics pipeline as above, developers can plug in actual services easily. The pseudocode serves as a blueprint:

* Where to call tracking events in the code.
* How to structure event payloads.
* The existence of an async queue or streaming system to handle events without blocking game logic (we decouple by pushing to `analyticsQueue`).
* Integration points for real analytics services or custom database storage.

This allows continuous improvement of the game: designers can see which puzzles are too hard (if `PuzzleAttempt solved=false` far outnumber solved=true), or if players are hoarding tokens instead of spending (tracking token balance distribution), etc., and then adjust content or mechanics accordingly.

## 10. Accessibility + i18n (i18next config, a11y utils)

**Accessibility (a11y):** We aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ensuring the game is playable by users with disabilities. Key strategies:

* Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for all interactive components. We have a utility library (e.g., `accessibility/` in lib) to manage focus and ARIA attributes.
* Ensure **keyboard navigation** throughout: all interactive elements (buttons, dialogue choices, links) are reachable via Tab/arrow keys. If we have custom components (like a dialogue choice list or inventory grid), we implement keyboard handling (arrow keys to move focus, Enter/Space to activate).
* Provide **screen reader support**: use ARIA labels to convey context. For example, when a new dialogue line appears, use an `aria-live="polite"` region to read it aloud. Ensure images (like Governor portraits or artifact icons) have `alt` text.
* Offer a **high-contrast mode** for visually impaired or colorblind users, and possibly a toggle for reduced animations for those with motion sensitivity.
* Test with axe (automated a11y tests) and manually with screen readers.

Accessibility utility pseudocode:

```tsx
// Example: A custom hook to trap focus within a modal (to ensure focus doesn't escape modals)
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function useFocusTrap(containerRef) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const firstFocusable = containerRef.current.querySelector('button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])');
    const focusableElements = containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])');
    const lastFocusable = focusableElements[focusableElements.length - 1];
    function handleKey(e) {
      if (e.key === 'Tab') {
        if (e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === firstFocusable) {
          e.preventDefault();
          lastFocusable.focus();
        } else if (!e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === lastFocusable) {
          e.preventDefault();
          firstFocusable.focus();
        }
      }
    }
    containerRef.current.addEventListener('keydown', handleKey);
    // On mount, focus the first element
    firstFocusable?.focus();
    return () => containerRef.current.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKey);
  }, [containerRef]);
}
```

```tsx
// Example: Announce changes to screen readers (using an aria-live region)
function ScreenReaderAnnouncer() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  useEffect(() => {
    // Listen to some global event bus for announcements
    const onAnnounce = (msg) => {
      setMessage(msg);
      // Clear message after announced (to allow same message again if needed)
      setTimeout(() => setMessage(""), 1000);
    };
    eventBus.on("announce", onAnnounce);
    return () => eventBus.off("announce", onAnnounce);
  }, []);
  return <div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">{message}</div>;
}

// To use: whenever something important happens (like dialogue text update):
eventBus.emit("announce", "Governor says: " + newDialogueText);
```

We also ensure **focus indication** is visible (never remove outlines without providing an alternative). Our Tailwind or CSS should include focus styles. Interactive components have clear focus states (e.g., `.focus:ring` outlines).

Additionally, run automated tests: using **jest-axe** and Testing Library to ensure no a11y violations in components. For example:

```tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';

test('GovernorDialogue is accessible', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<GovernorDialogue governorId={1} />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

We include such tests in CI so that any new UI component must pass accessibility checks (foundation goal: automated a11y testing in CI).

**Internationalization (i18n):** The game targets a global audience, so we use **react-i18next** for multi-language support. We configure i18next with multiple locales and load translations from JSON files:

* We have a `locales/` directory with subfolders for each language (en, es, fr, de, zh). Within each, JSON files for different namespaces (e.g., `common.json` for UI strings, `game.json` for game-specific text).
* Example `en/common.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "menu": {
      "inventory": "Inventory",
      "governors": "Governors",
      "profile": "Profile"
    },
    "actions": {
      "interact": "Commune",
      "offer": "Offer Tokens",
      "solve": "Solve Puzzle"
    }
  }
  ```

  and a corresponding `es/common.json` with Spanish translations.
* We use i18next's LanguageDetector to pick up the user's locale (from browser or a setting) and fallback to English if not available.

Initialize i18n (e.g., in `i18n/config.ts`):

```ts
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

i18n
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    supportedLngs: ['en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'zh'],
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: false,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false  // not needed for React output
    },
    resources: {
      en: {
        common: require('../locales/en/common.json'),
        game: require('../locales/en/game.json')
      },
      es: {
        common: require('../locales/es/common.json'),
        game: require('../locales/es/game.json')
      },
      // ... other languages ...
    }
  });
export default i18n;
```

We then wrap our app with `I18nextProvider` and use the `useTranslation` hook in components:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

function Menu() {
  const { t } = useTranslation('common');
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/governors">{t('menu.governors')}</a></li>
        <li><a href="/inventory">{t('menu.inventory')}</a></li>
        <li><a href="/profile">{t('menu.profile')}</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

All user-visible text in components should be via `t()` so that it can be translated. We extract translatable strings using `i18next-parser` (set up in scripts). This parser scans our source code for `t('key')` usage and updates the locale JSON files with any new keys, ensuring translators know what to translate. We enforce in CI that no hard-coded strings exist and that all locales have corresponding entries (foundation had an i18n validation pipeline).

For **lore content**, since it is large and narrative, translating it is a bigger effort. However, our content management system can support multiple language versions, or we can include the essential bits in the i18n files if feasible. A likely approach is to duplicate content files per language (e.g., `content/es/governors/1.json` for a Spanish version of Governor 1's profile). The content service could serve the version based on a query param or header. This way, as we expand, we can localize dialogues and descriptions as well.

Finally, the UI should allow language switching (a dropdown or auto-detect with override). Changing the language triggers i18next to load new resources and re-render text. We ensure date/time formats (block timestamps, etc.) and numbers are localized (using `Intl` or i18next formatting).

By scaffolding these a11y and i18n components now, we bake inclusivity into the project:

* The **AccessibilityProvider** (foundation step had one) can apply global tweaks like focus outlines or high-contrast theme toggling easily.
* The testing in CI catches regressions (e.g., if someone introduces an <img> without alt, `jest-axe` will flag it).
* The i18n structure ensures we won't hardcode strings, making it straightforward to add languages. Our success criteria is supporting at least 5 languages fully – the template above paves the way to achieve that by having all text externalized and easily translatable.

## 11. Testing + CI/CD Scaffolds (Unit, E2E, Smart Contract Security)

To maintain reliability, we implement comprehensive testing at multiple levels and integrate them into a Continuous Integration pipeline.

**Unit Testing:** Each module of the system (front-end components, contract logic, backend services) has unit tests.

* Front-end: using Jest and React Testing Library for components. E.g., test that `GovernorDialogue` renders the correct text for a given state, or that `EnergyMeter` correctly displays when energy is full vs empty.
* Contract: we use Rust's test framework to run simulated contract calls on the Alkanes logic. For example, test that `offerTokens` increases reputation correctly or that cooldown prevents a second interaction:

  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_offering_reputation_gain() {
      let mut player = Player::new(TEST_ADDR, 0);
      player.tokens = 50;
      let gov = GovernorId(1);
      offerTokens(&mut player, gov, 10);
      assert_eq!(player.reputation.get(&gov), Some(&2)); // assuming 10 tokens -> +2 rep
      assert_eq!(player.tokens, 40);
  }

  #[test]
  fn test_cooldown_enforced() {
      let mut player = Player::new(TEST_ADDR, 100); // starting at block 100
      player.last_interact.insert(GovernorId(5), 95);
      let res = interact(&mut player, GovernorId(5), Action::DialogueChoice(1), 100);
      assert!(res.is_err());  // should fail because only 5 blocks passed < 144
  }
  ```
* Backend: test GraphQL resolvers in isolation (e.g., feed in a sample DB state and ensure the Query returns expected data). Also test the content service (e.g., hitting an endpoint returns proper JSON).
* Utilities: any helper functions (like parsing or the analytics queue) get tests.

We aim for high coverage on critical logic (especially contract and any finance-related code).

**End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Using a tool like Cypress or Playwright, we simulate a user's journey:

* Start the dev server, use a test wallet (with deterministic keys and some testnet funds or a stubbed signing).
* Perform actions: log in with a test wallet (could stub signature), go through a sample dialogue, attempt a puzzle, etc.
* Assert on expected outcomes: e.g., after an interaction, check that the UI shows rep increased, check that the indexer's GraphQL reports the new rep, maybe even inspect that a Bitcoin transaction was broadcast (on testnet/regtest).
* We can set up a **regtest** Bitcoin node with the Alkanes contract and indexer connected, enabling deterministic e2e tests that actually mine a block for a test transaction. Alternatively, stub the indexer responses for known actions (less integration but simpler).

Example pseudo-test with Playwright:

```js
// E2E test: offering tokens increases reputation
test('Offering tokens to Governor increases reputation', async ({ page }) => {
  // Assume test wallet is already loaded with address "player1"
  await page.goto('/governors/5');
  // Ensure initial rep is 0
  const repDisplay = await page.locator('.rep-value');
  expect(await repDisplay.innerText()).toBe("0");
  // Perform offering
  await page.click('button.offer-tokens');  // triggers offering of say 5 tokens
  // Wait for transaction confirmation (could simulate block mine if on regtest)
  await page.waitForSelector('.toast-success');
  // Verify rep increased
  expect(await repDisplay.innerText()).toBeGreaterThan("0");
});
```

We would run such tests in CI (perhaps on a nightly basis if they rely on spinning up a Bitcoin regtest, which might be slower).

**Smart Contract Security Testing:** Since this is an on-chain game, we must be diligent about contract security:

* We include tests for edge cases: e.g., what if a player somehow tries to overflow reputation, or uses a negative token amount? Our contract functions should handle these (Rust's type system and ensure! macros help, but we test anyway).
* We can use property-based testing (like proptests in Rust) for certain invariants: e.g., no matter what sequence of valid actions, a player's rep should never exceed 100, energy never goes negative, tokens burned never magically increase someone else's tokens, etc.
* Integration with security analysis tools: The roadmap suggests using **Slither** and **Echidna** – those are for Ethereum (Solidity) primarily, but since Alkanes is a custom protocol, we might adapt or use similar formal analysis. Possibly, we could use something like the **Mirai** or **Miri** analyzers for Rust to catch unsafe behaviors, or if any part of contract is in Bitcoin Script, use Sapio's safety checks, etc.
* Additionally, we plan periodic audits (quarterly external audit per roadmap budget). In CI, we can run `cargo audit` to find vulnerable dependencies in Rust, and maybe a custom linter for common mistakes.

**Bitcoin-Native CI/CD Pipeline:** Our simplified pipeline focuses on Bitcoin inscription deployment:

* **Code Quality**: Run linters (ESLint, Rust fmt/clippy) and unit tests for client-side code
* **Content Validation**: Validate governor profiles, quest logic, and inscription metadata  
* **PWA Build**: Build client-side Progressive Web App bundle optimized for inscription
* **Alkanes Contract Testing**: Test smart contract logic on Bitcoin regtest/testnet
* **Security Audits**: Run automated security scans on WASM contracts before inscription
* **Accessibility Testing**: Run jest-axe and Lighthouse CI for PWA compliance

The Bitcoin-native architecture eliminates 99% of traditional DevOps complexity while providing superior reliability, permanence, and global distribution through the Bitcoin network.

## 12. ❌ **REMOVED**: CDN, Deployment + Infrastructure (Replaced by Bitcoin-Native Architecture)

⚠️ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**: Traditional cloud infrastructure eliminated

**OLD APPROACH (Removed):**
- ❌ Cloudflare CDN for asset caching
- ❌ AWS CloudFront for content delivery
- ❌ Traditional hosting infrastructure
- ❌ Cache invalidation strategies

**NEW BITCOIN-NATIVE APPROACH:**

**Bitcoin Ordinal Asset Delivery (Replaces CDN):**
All game assets are permanently inscribed on Bitcoin, eliminating need for traditional content delivery networks:

* **Global Distribution**: Assets distributed via Bitcoin network nodes globally
* **Permanent Availability**: No cache invalidation needed - assets are immutable
* **Zero Hosting Costs**: No CDN fees or infrastructure maintenance
* **Censorship Resistance**: Cannot be taken down or blocked

**Minimal Infrastructure Required:**

⚠️ **DRAMATICALLY SIMPLIFIED**: Only essential services needed

**Required Components:**
* **MetaShrew Indexer**: Single service for Bitcoin blockchain indexing
* **Bitcoin Node**: Full node for blockchain data (can be hosted or self-managed)
* **Optional Domain**: For web access to PWA (clients can also run locally)

**Deployment Approach:**
```bash
# Bitcoin-native deployment (replaces complex Kubernetes/Docker)
# 1. Inscribe PWA client to Bitcoin
inscription_id=$(ordinals wallet inscribe client/dist/)

# 2. Deploy minimal indexer (single container)
docker run -d metashrew/indexer:latest

# 3. Update manifest with new inscription ID
echo '{"client": "'$inscription_id'"}' > manifest.json
ordinals wallet inscribe manifest.json

# 4. Game is now "deployed" permanently on Bitcoin
echo "Game deployed to Bitcoin. Client ID: $inscription_id"
```

**No Traditional Infrastructure Needed:**
- ❌ Kubernetes clusters
- ❌ Load balancers  
- ❌ CDN services
- ❌ Application servers
- ❌ Database clusters (except indexer's internal Postgres)

**Secrets Management (Dramatically Simplified):**

⚠️ **MOST SECRETS ELIMINATED**: Bitcoin-native architecture requires minimal secrets

**Removed Secret Categories:**
- ❌ JWT signing keys (no server-side auth)
- ❌ OAuth client secrets (no social login)
- ❌ Database passwords (minimal DB use)
- ❌ CDN API keys (no CDN)
- ❌ Application server credentials

**Remaining Minimal Secrets:**
* **Bitcoin Node Credentials**: RPC access to Bitcoin node
* **MetaShrew Database**: Indexer's internal Postgres credentials
* **Optional Analytics Keys**: If using client-side analytics

**Simplified Secret Management:**
```bash
# Minimal secrets needed (can use environment variables)
export BITCOIN_RPC_USER="readonly_user"
export BITCOIN_RPC_PASS="secure_password"
export INDEXER_DB_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/indexer"

# No complex Vault infrastructure needed
```

**Revolutionary Bitcoin-Native Deployment:**

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# ⚠️ **NEW**: Bitcoin-native deployment script (replaces complex cloud infrastructure)

# 1. Build PWA client bundle  
npm run build:pwa

# 2. Inscribe all game assets to Bitcoin (one-time permanent deployment)
echo "Inscribing game client to Bitcoin..."
CLIENT_INSCRIPTION=$(ordinals wallet inscribe --file client/dist/ --fee-rate 10)

echo "Inscribing game assets to Bitcoin..."
ASSETS_INSCRIPTION=$(ordinals wallet inscribe --file assets/ --fee-rate 10)

echo "Inscribing game content to Bitcoin..."
CONTENT_INSCRIPTION=$(ordinals wallet inscribe --file content/ --fee-rate 10)

# 3. Create and inscribe manifest (replaces Terraform/Kubernetes config)
cat << EOF > deployment-manifest.json
{
  "client": "$CLIENT_INSCRIPTION",
  "assets": "$ASSETS_INSCRIPTION", 
  "content": "$CONTENT_INSCRIPTION",
  "contracts": {
    "alkanes": "$ALKANES_CONTRACT_ID"
  },
  "indexer": {
    "metashrew_endpoint": "https://indexer.enochian.game/graphql"
  }
}
EOF

MANIFEST_INSCRIPTION=$(ordinals wallet inscribe --file deployment-manifest.json --fee-rate 10)

# 4. Game is now permanently deployed on Bitcoin
echo "✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!"
echo "🌐 Game permanently deployed to Bitcoin blockchain"
echo "📋 Manifest: $MANIFEST_INSCRIPTION"
echo "🎮 Players can access via: https://ordinals.com/inscription/$CLIENT_INSCRIPTION"
echo "💾 Total cost: ~$50-200 (one-time, permanent)"
echo "🚀 Zero ongoing hosting costs"
```

**Minimal Infrastructure (replaces Terraform):**

```yaml
# docker-compose.minimal.yml - Only for MetaShrew indexer
version: '3.8'
services:
  indexer:
    image: metashrew/indexer:latest
    environment:
      - BITCOIN_RPC_URL=https://bitcoin.node.com:8332
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://indexer:pass@db:5432/metashrew
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"  # GraphQL endpoint
      
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=metashrew
      - POSTGRES_USER=indexer
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_pass
    volumes:
      - indexer_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
