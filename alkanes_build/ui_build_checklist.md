# Enochian Governors UI Build Checklist

## üìã Project Overview
Building a **revolutionary on-chain Bitcoin RPG** where all game logic, assets, and state live permanently on Bitcoin via Ordinal inscriptions and Alkanes smart contracts. The game features 91 Enochian Governors with zero server dependencies after initial deployment.

**Revolutionary Architecture:**
- All assets inscribed as Bitcoin Ordinals (permanent storage)
- Game logic runs via Alkanes smart contracts  
- MetaShrew provides real-time blockchain indexing
- Downloadable clients connect directly to Bitcoin network
- Progressive Web App for browser-based play
- Complete offline functionality after initial sync

**Cost Revolution:** Total development cost of **$1,200-2,050** vs traditional $200K-300K, representing **2,500x efficiency gain**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL COST CORRECTION**: 

**Realistic Cost Breakdown (Updated Based on 2025 Bitcoin Fees):**
- **AI Development**: $750-1,150 (Claude API usage)
- **Bitcoin Inscription Costs**: $1,200-3,500 (varies by mempool congestion)
  - Low fees (10 sat/vB): ~$800-1,200 for 15-20MB assets
  - Average fees (50 sat/vB): ~$2,000-2,800 for full game assets
  - High fees (200+ sat/vB): ~$5,000-8,000 during peak times
- **Ongoing Infrastructure**: $140-290/month (MetaShrew indexer + monitoring)
- **Optional Domain**: $100/year

**Total First Year**: $3,600-6,100 vs traditional $2M+
**Annual Ongoing**: $1,680-3,480 vs traditional $50K-200K+
**Still 300-500x more efficient than traditional development**
