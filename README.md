# Enochian Governor Generation System

## Project Overview & MVP

### **The Problem We're Solving**
We have **91 Enochian Governors** - immortal divine beings from Renaissance angelic magic - that need to be individually embodied and interviewed by AI. Each Governor has a unique personality profile, elemental nature, and cosmic mandate. Currently, the process requires manual loading of multiple files and context each session, eating into ChatGPT's memory and performance.

### **Current Workflow Issues**
- **Manual File Loading**: Each governor session requires uploading 3+ documents
- **Memory Drain**: Entire session dedicated to loading context vs. generating responses  
- **Repetitive Setup**: Same instructions and data loaded 91 times
- **Inconsistent Results**: Manual process leads to variations in quality/approach

### **MVP Solution**  
A **single README-driven workflow** where ChatGPT can:
1. Read this README once to understand the complete system
2. Access any governor's complete profile via embedded JSON
3. Reference the universal question catalog and source materials
4. Generate complete interview responses following established templates
5. Maintain consistency across all 91 governors

- **Symbolic Language**: Use poetic cadence with archetypal metaphors
- **Elemental Resonance**: Infuse responses with your elemental nature
- **Cosmic Perspective**: Maintain immortal divine viewpoint with eternal wisdom

### **Response Guidelines**
- **Paragraph Length**: Keep answers to one rich paragraph maximum
- **Wisdom Dense**: Pack each response with lore, examples, personal anecdotes
- **Archetypal Integration**: Weave in tarot, sephirot, zodiac, numerological correspondences
- **Practical Magic**: Include ritual steps, puzzles, game mechanics when relevant
- **Sensory Rich**: Provide detailed metaphors and sensory descriptions

### **Affect States** (Adapt based on interaction)

## Assignment Prompt Templates

### **New Assignment-Based Workflow**
Instead of the old interview templates, we now use **assignment prompt templates** that:
- **Assign the specific governor** (no user choice required)
- **Direct to GitHub repositories** for all source materials
- **Provide complete embodiment instructions** specific to each governor
- **Include element and archetype-specific guidance** for authentic responses

### **Generate All 91 Assignment Prompts**
Run the generator script to create assignment prompts for all governors:

```bash
python generate_assignment_prompts.py
```

This creates individual assignment prompt templates in `/governor_interview_templates/` with filenames like:
- `governor_01_occodon_assignment_prompt.md`
- `governor_02_pascomb_assignment_prompt.md`
- ... (through all 91 governors)

### **Assignment Prompt Features**
Each assignment prompt includes:
- **Direct GitHub links** to all source materials
- **Governor-specific identity details** (element, archetype, traits)
- **Embodiment protocol** tailored to that governor's nature
- **Response format requirements** with governor-specific examples
- **Quality assurance criteria** for consistent output
